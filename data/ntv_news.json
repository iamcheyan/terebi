        "description": "“We got a phone call from the residence at that address on 17th street,\" Elliot mentioned. \"They heard gunshots.”\n\nElliott then said the victims walked outside and can’t be 100% sure if it was related, but noticed their windshields shattered and stomped on.\n\n“Footprints or shoeprints were seen on the dust on the vehicles and then they noticed there were gunshots or bullet holes in the vehicles, as well,” Elliott noted.\n\nAccording to Elliott, the attack appeared to be targeted.\n\n“We're hoping that our victims cooperate and help us to identify who our suspects are and then bring those suspects to justice,” Elliott announced.\n\nIn recent years, GIPD has committed itself to reducing crime in the city. In fact, in 2024, the crime rate dropped by just over 14% with goals of continuing to decrease that number by 15-20% in 2025 and Chief Elliott told me they were hoping for 10-15% reduction at this point in the year.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/gunfire-damages-vehicles-and-home-in-grand-island#",

        "description": "Nebraska wrapped up its final preseason football practice in Lincoln on Tuesday before turning its focus to Thursday night’s opener against Cincinnati in Kansas City.\n\nHead coach Matt Rhule said he is eager to man the sidelines under the bright lights.\n\n“The team’s been great. I think they want to play — it’s very evident, a very mature team,” Rhule said.\n\nAs he enters his third season in Lincoln, Rhule emphasized that he wants this year to feel different, starting with himself.\n\n“I very much made a commitment this year to having fun in everything that I do because it’s the type of team we have,” Rhule said.\n\nRhule added that the Huskers are more prepared for the opener than in past years.\n\n“We’re significantly further ahead in terms of how we handle a game excited to see them actually play it out,” he said.\n\nPart of the preseason preparation included film sessions reviewing dozens of plays from last year. Rhule said the team approached it with “humility and accountability,” noting that too many “bad football plays” stood out.\n\nTen Blackshirts were awarded this week, a tradition dating back to 1964, with the hope of turning preparation into better play on the field.\n\n“Just challenging the guys — we want to go play this game one snap at a time, with intentional focus, a neutral mindset and attack each play,” Rhule said.\n\nThe Huskers will travel to Kansas City as a team on Wednesday, hold a walkthrough, meet together, and even share a movie night watching “Superman” before Thursday’s 8 p.m. kickoff.",

        "description": "Coming out of a bye week, Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said his team is rested, refocused, and ready to respond after a three-point loss to Michigan.\n\nRhule pointed to the work ethic during the off week as a sign of progress, noting players like tight end Luke Lenemeyer, who was out on the practice field doing drills on his own.\n\n“We came out of the bye week feeling really good about a lot of guys in terms of where they’re at,” Rhule said. “I thought the team got a lot better last week.”\n\nNebraska (3-1, 0-1 Big Ten) will host Michigan State (3-1, 1-0) on Saturday. The Spartans are averaging more than 34 points per game behind quarterback Aidan Chiles, who has completed over 70% of his passes this season while also posing a threat as a runner.\n\n“They’re a pro-style offense, and he does all the pro-style things,” Rhule said. “He’s taking what’s there, protecting the football. He’s one of the better quarterbacks in the Big Ten.”\n\nStatistically, Nebraska brings one of the nation’s most explosive passing attacks, averaging 352 yards per game — second best in the FBS. But Rhule acknowledged that the Huskers’ running game and rush defense still need improvement. Nebraska is allowing 173 rushing yards per contest, which ranks outside the top 100 nationally.\n\nOn the injury front, Rhule said cornerback Malcolm Hartzog is doubtful to play. Hartzog had the game-clinching interception against Cincinnati earlier this month.\n\nKickoff against Michigan State is set for 3 p.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "description": "The Kansas City Royals are chasing a playoff berth and could soon get a boost from their top draft pick a year ago, Jack Caglione. But before the power-hitting prospect can join the big-league lineup, he has to master a new position — the outfield.\n\nCaglione, known as “Jack Cags,” has been working on the transition this summer with the Royals' Triple-A team, the Omaha Storm Chasers. A natural infielder and pitcher, he has spent the last several weeks learning the intricacies of the outfield with the help of Royals coach Rusty Kuntz, a former big leaguer who played in the 1980s.\n\n“I’m pretty comfortable out there,” Caglione said. “There are still some plays I’m not used to seeing. It’s a lot different than first, but that’s the learning process. Thankfully, Rusty’s out here helping me.”\n\nThe Royals value Caglione’s bat — he has already shown home run power in Triple-A — but need him to become dependable defensively before he makes the jump to Kansas City. Kuntz said the focus has been on fundamentals like taking proper routes and getting under control to make plays.\n\n“I’ve got to remember that he was not an outfielder,” Kuntz said. “He was an infielder and a pitcher, and now some of the things I just throw at him, I have to step back and go, ‘Wait a minute, we’re still learning this process.’”\n\nCaglione, meanwhile, is keeping a close eye on the standings.\n\n“I’d love to be playing in October,” he said.\n\nKuntz believes the young slugger has the mentality to get there.\n\n“He’s an absolute dream because he’s a baseball player first,” Kuntz said. “He just wants to come out and compete, and he’ll work his butt off. That’s a coach’s dream.”\n\nThe Royals expect Caglione to rejoin the team in September as they push toward the postseason.",

        "description": "The Cornhuskers have had a fortnight to stew over their loss to Michigan, but head coach Matt Rhule said his team is ready to put that behind them as they prepare to face Michigan State on Saturday.\n\n“The week’s been great,” Rhule said Friday during his final press conference of the week at Memorial Stadium. “They practiced hard last week. They practiced hard this week, so they’ll be ready on Saturday.”\n\nThe weather could play a role in the matchup. With high winds and temperatures expected in the mid-80s, Rhule said Nebraska has been preparing for all conditions. “It’ll be a factor in everything that you do,” he said. “It might mean you make some different decisions than you normally would. It’s part of being in the region of the country that we’re in.”\n\nNebraska has not defeated Michigan State since 2018, but Rhule is confident in his team’s preparation. “I’m expecting our players to go play really, really well. I think they’ve improved. We’re just gonna play it out and see what happens,” he said.\n\nKickoff against Michigan State is set for 3 p.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Rhule Previews Huskers vs. Michigan in Big Ten Opener",
        "description": "Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule previewed the Huskers’ first Big Ten game of the season, a home matchup Saturday against No. 21 Michigan.\n\nThe Wolverines (2-1) enter the contest without head coach Sherrone Moore, who is serving the second game of a three-game suspension for NCAA violations. Interim coach Biff Poggi, who previously coached at Charlotte, will lead Michigan after the team’s 63-3 win over Central Michigan last weekend.\n\nThe quarterback battle is expected to headline the game. Michigan will start true freshman Bryce Underwood in his first Big Ten appearance, while Nebraska (3-0) turns to sophomore second-year starter Dylan Raiola. Raiola has thrown for 829 yards, eight touchdowns, and no interceptions through three games, leading an offense that ranks fifth nationally in passing at 366 yards per game.\n\n“If we have great protection — and we’ve had great protection — then the quarterback’s going to be unbelievably efficient,” Rhule said.\n\nNebraska’s defense has been equally impressive, allowing just 66 passing yards per game to lead the nation. Michigan ranks 81st in passing offense at 212 yards per game and 43rd in passing defense at 182.\n\nRhule emphasized balance and execution as keys to Nebraska’s success. The Huskers have not had a three-and-out in the past two games but continue to focus on red-zone efficiency.\n\n“We’ve always had a period for it, but we’ll add some emphasis this week and try to get better,” Rhule said.\n\nOn the injury front, Rhule confirmed defensive backs Malcolm Hartzog and Javin Wright will return after missing last week’s game as a precaution.\n\nRhule, who attended Terence “Bud” Crawford’s recent fight in Las Vegas, said he wants his team to seize its own opportunity on the national stage against a ranked opponent.\n\nKickoff between Nebraska and Michigan is set for Saturday in Lincoln at 2:30 PM CST.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "description": "KEARNEY, Neb. — Senator Pete Ricketts made a stop in Kearney as part of his statewide reelection campaign, where he took aim at his opponent, Dan Osborn. Ricketts accused Osborn of being a Democrat who would obstruct former President Trump's agenda.\n\n\"You can bet that's where he's going to put his allegiance if he were to get elected. That's why it's so important that we beat fake Dan Osborn and send a real conservative to Washington,\" said Ricketts.\n\nOsborn, who previously ran against Deb Fischer in 2024 and made national headlines when he garnered 46.7% of the vote, is also conducting a series of town halls. He previously emphasized his opposition to the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" and his connection to the working class, contrasting his background with Ricketts'.\n\n\"Ricketts is certainly a bigger contrast from me. This story writes itself about his background and my background,\" said Osborn.\n\nRicketts' event featured remarks from Representative Adrian Smith and local officials, including Kearney Mayor Jonathan Nikkila, State Senator Stan Clouse and State Board of Education Representative Sherry Jones. In contrast, Osborn's previous town hall in Hastings was more informal and included a question-and-answer session.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/ricketts-and-osborn-trade-barbs-in-nebraska-senate-race#",

        "description": "Nebraska defensive back Malcolm Hartzog Jr. intercepted a pass in the end zone with 34 seconds remaining, sealing a season-opening victory for the Huskers at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday night.\n\nThe play capped a night where first-year defensive coordinator John Butler’s emphasis on situational football paid off. “Yeah, this is going to build us some confidence for sure,” Hartzog said. “A lot of people say we can’t win a close game, so winning that close game right there just makes us know we can do it.”\n\nWhile the defense made the final stop, the Huskers will look to shore up their rushing defense before next week’s matchup against Akron. Nebraska allowed 202 rushing yards on 30 carries.\n\nOn the offensive side, new starting running back Emmett Johnson delivered in his debut. Johnson carried the ball 25 times for more than 108 yards and added 10 receptions for 27 yards. “Feels great, man, but I can only give credit to my O-line,” Johnson said. “I’m willing to do whatever it takes for this team to win.”\n\n Sophomore Quarterback Dylan Raiola, entering his second season as the starter, threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns, including a fourth-and-2 conversion to transfer wide receiver Dane Key. Raiola said the win was encouraging but noted room for improvement. “There’s some third downs, some fourth downs that we wish we could have had back, but that’s game one and the growing pains,” Raiola said. “I’m just glad we left here with a W.”\n\nRaiola had ice on his hand postgame but did not comment on any injury. Head coach Matt Rhule also did not mention it.\n\nNebraska fans dominated the Arrowhead crowd of more than 70,000. Rhule estimated 65,000 supporters made the trip south to Kansas City, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe Huskers (1-0) return to Lincoln next Saturday for their home opener at Memorial Stadium against Akron. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m.\n\n#gobigred #huskersfb #cornhuskers #nebraska",

        "description": "Nebraska head coach Dani Busboom Kelly meets with the media to discuss the Huskers’ upcoming matches and where the team is trending. She says she isn’t concerned about passing, noting the team is putting up strong numbers and that the criticism is mostly nitpicking. She highlights Bergen’s strong play, the historic offensive numbers the team is producing, and the mindset of taking things point by point instead of overanalyzing individual moments.\n\nDani talks about the consistency of hitting .300 as a team and how impressive it is to do it night after night with a balanced offense. She credits Bergen for blocking well, sticking to game plans, and making adjustments even when those plans change from match to match. She also expands on her coaching philosophy and how the team continues to grow with clean play and high-level execution.\n\nLooking ahead, Dani says Illinois is off to a great start and points out their setter, who she played against in her Louisville days when the setter was at Florida State. She says Illinois’ outside is playing at a high level and that it’s always fun to coach against former assistants. She also previews Minnesota, a team dealing with injuries but still staying in the top 25 with one of the best outsides in the country. She expects a challenge on the road.\n\nDani closes by talking about what it means for high school teams to get to play at the Devaney Center and how big of a deal that experience is.\n\nSubscribe for more Nebraska volleyball press conferences, interviews, and coverage.\n\n#HuskerVB #GBR #NebraskaVolleyball #bergenreilly #rebekahallick #HuskerSports #danibussboomkelly",

        "description": "Bergen Reilly and Allie Sczech met with the media after Nebraska’s win over Utah to reflect on dropping the first set and bouncing back. They talked about how serving pressure changed the match, the importance of keeping Utah out of system, and how playing a ranked opponent helps prepare them for the tournament. Reilly credited her hitters for stepping up and highlighted how a balanced offense makes the team tough to stop, while Czech said the practices leading up to the match paid off on the court. Both players emphasized the depth of the roster, the competitiveness within their position groups, and the support they have for one another on and off the court.\n\n\n#HuskerVB #GBR #nebraskavolleyball  #DaniBussboomKelly #bergenreilly #HuskerSports #alliesczech",

        "description": "The Nebraska volleyball team is gearing up for its annual alumni match Saturday at the Bob Devaney Sports Center, now home to the newly named John Cook Arena.\n\nHead coach Dani Busboom Kelly said she’s eager for her team to face new opponents while also seeing familiar faces from the program’s past.\n\n“You’d like to think we’re going to be quite a bit more organized, so we have an edge, but you can’t count out Olympians,” Busboom Kelly said. “Some of these players haven’t played in the last month, but they just finished pro seasons, and we’re playing at a really high level. I’m expecting them to be pretty good on the other side.”\n\nAmong the alumni returning are stars such as Jordan Larson, Lauren Stiverins, Kenzie Maloney, Allie Badenhorst, and Lindsey Krause. For Busboom Kelly, the focus is on sharpening fundamentals and testing the depth of her roster.\n\n“Our practices are really tough,” she said. “That’s just going to make us stronger in the end. That’s why I’m very excited to play against somebody else.”\n\nWith the alumni match only six days before Nebraska’s first game in the AVCA Kickoff, the contest serves as a true test of where the team stands.\n\nOutside hitter Harper Murray said fall practice has been intense. “Two-a-days are really hard, but we get through it together,” she said. “I’m looking forward to facing some familiar faces and meeting some of the alumni. It’s gonna be fun playing against them.”\n\nAssistant coach and alum Kelly Hunter Natter will also step onto the court for the match. “It’s really exciting,” Natter said. “It’s a good chance to see a lot of my former teammates and alums that you don’t get to see all that often.”\n\nBusboom Kelly said if the alumni match proves successful, the program hopes to make it an annual tradition, similar to other top volleyball programs.\n\nThe match takes place Saturday, August 16th at 6 PM at the Bob Devaney Sports Center.",

        "description": "Nebraska volleyball is preparing to make its debut at Pinnacle Bank Arena, a stage the program has never played on before. While the Huskers have hosted games at Memorial Stadium and the Devaney Sports Center, Friday’s matchup against Pitt will mark the first time the team takes the court in the 16,000-seat arena.\n\n“24 hours from now, 16,000 fans will pack it out, seeing Big Red and PBA for the first time,” Nebraska head coach Dani Busboom-Kelly said. “I feel like we’ve done everything as a program, and this is one thing I get to do as a head coach, so that’s pretty cool.”\n\nTeam captains say the experience feels monumental.\n\n“It feels like we’re in December already, like a Final Four environment,” junior setter Bergren Reilly said. “We know the fans are going to bring it, which will make it even better.”\n\nBeing named captain is an honor, the players said, but not the team’s ultimate goal.\n\n“It’s a big honor to be a captain at Nebraska, but everybody knows that’s not the main goal of the season,” said Reilly. \n\nSenior middle blocker Rebekah Allick said, “It’s something I’ll get to look back on, but right now it doesn’t change much. We already have so many leaders.”\n\nThe team has practiced at the Devaney Sports Center and says the transition to PBA will be smooth.\n\n“It’ll be really cool to have a big home-court advantage,” Reilly said. “We get to be in a bigger place than Devaney, and we’ve watched a lot of other events here. It’s exciting to be one of them.”\n\nThe Huskers will face Pitt at 6 PM CST on Friday in the first match at Pinnacle Bank Arena. \n\n#HuskerVolleyball #NebraskaVolleyball #VolleyballCaptains #2025Season #Huskers #andijackson #bergrenreilly #rebekahallick #gobigred #gbr",

        "title": "Kearney restaurant owners respond to backlash over Kirk post.",
        "description": "KEARNEY, Neb. — A local Kearney business owner has spoken out to clarify remarks she made on social media following the shooting of Charlie Kirk, a few weeks ago. Which sparked significant backlash and misunderstanding.\n\nCindy Houlden, silent partner at The Lodge Restaurant, addressed the controversy surrounding a Facebook post that was quickly shared and taken out of context. She explained that her original post was online for less than a minute and that only part of it was circulated widely.\n\n“Our grandmother used to say there’s three sides to every story: his side, her side, and the truth. Well, there’s three sides to this story, too,\" said Houlden.\n\nTo clarify what was actually said online, Houlden emphasized that she did not justify the shooting in any way. Instead, her message focused on the broader consequences of division and hatred in the country. “What I meant by karma is the karma we all have to live with with our actions as we go forward,” she said. She expressed concern that ongoing societal divisions could lead to further tragedies.\n\n“My post said that what happened to Charlie Kirk is not justified in any way shape or form,\" added Houlden. \"No matter how divisive some people may have found his words, but with that said what I meant by karma is the karma we all have to live with, with our actions as we go forward.”\n\nDespite her intentions to promote reflection and unity, Houlden and the business faced immediate backlash. Threatening comments flooded her social media, prompting Facebook to warn her about potential threats. Sales at The Lodge have reportedly dropped significantly.\n\n“We’ve seen a major impact on the sales and what’s happened to the business,” noted Robert James, The Lodge Restaurant Co-Owner and Kitchen Manager.\n\nThis crushes James. “It’s breaking my heart to see it die,” he said.\n\nHatred didn’t stop with simply attacking the owners and their business. Houlden mentioned threats were made against her employees including coming after high schoolers. “When this initially happened, we lost 80% of our workforce,” said James.\n\nThe threats extended beyond the owners to employees, including young workers and local students. In response, Houlden contacted Kearney Public Schools and the University of Nebraska at Kearney to alert them to threats circulating online.\n\nHoulden called for open dialogue and community unity, urging people to come together over shared meals and conversations. “When you have children, is this the world you want them to grow up in?” she asked.\n\nShe said she hopes to stop what she called destructive behavior. “And I feel it towards both sides, but I’ve never felt the hate from the left that I feel from the right. I’ll be honest,” noted Houlden.\n\nShe also clarified her role in the business, stating that James primarily owns and operates The Lodge while she manages the books and finances. Both owners have expressed disbelief at how the situation escalated.\n\nThe incident highlights growing tensions in communities across the country, underscoring the challenges faced by individuals trying to express nuanced views in a highly polarized environment.",

        "title": "Nebraska Football Head Coach Matt Rhule Signs Contract Extension",
        "description": "Stability is the theme in Lincoln as Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule has signed a contract extension that keeps him with the Cornhuskers through 2032.\n\nRhule, who originally signed a deal through 2030, said earlier this year that he wanted to stay in Lincoln — and made good on that statement by putting pen to paper.\n\n“I’m very, very grateful to Troy Dannen, to UNL President Gold, to the board for their confidence in me and our staff,” Rhule said. “Very grateful to my wife and kids who allowed me to do this job and moved here. I’m very grateful to the fan base, the city of Lincoln, and the state of Nebraska. This has become our home.”\n\nRhule added that the new deal is about stability and long-term success, not just for himself but for the program.\n\n“Hopefully it sends a message to recruits and players that this is the place to be — and we want to be here,” Rhule said. “I love this team and I love where we’re headed.”\n\nNebraska Athletic Director Troy Dannen said conversations about the extension began over the summer and intensified around Week 3 of the season.\n\n“I believe in the program. I believe in Matt,” Dannen said. “We needed to get the buyout reset if we possibly could. That’s really why I initiated the discussions when I did.”\n\nThe new contract does not include a base salary increase but does reset the buyout and add performance-based incentives. Rhule will continue to earn $7.5 million this year, increasing to $12.5 million by 2030. Each time Nebraska reaches the College Football Playoff Round of 16, his base pay rises by another $1 million.\n\nSince arriving in Lincoln, Rhule has guided the Huskers to their first winning season in eight years and their first bowl victory since 2015. This fall, Nebraska is 6–2, marking the program’s best eight-game start in nine seasons.\n\n“We could have gone somewhere else probably — but we want to be here,” Rhule said. “Not like, ‘Hey, we’ve got to be here.’ We want to be here.”\n\nFor Nebraska fans and recruits alike, the message is clear: Rhule, Dannen, and the administration are united — and they believe the best years for Cornhusker football are still ahead.\n\n#GBR #Huskers #MattRhule #NebraskaFootball #HuskerSports\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #nebraskafootball",

        "description": "In a tightly contested Big Ten opener, No. 21 Michigan edged Nebraska 30–27 on Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln. The Wolverines improved to 3–1 overall and 1–0 in conference play, while the Cornhuskers fell to 3–1 and 0–1 in the Big Ten. \n\nMichigan's offense was propelled by a dominant ground game, amassing 286 rushing yards. Running back Justice Haynes led the charge with 149 yards on 17 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run. Freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood added 105 passing yards and a 37-yard touchdown run. Jordan Marshall contributed with a 54-yard touchdown run, marking his first significant play of the season. \nMaize n Brew\n\nDefensively, the Wolverines were relentless, recording seven sacks and 10 tackles for loss. Linebacker Cole Sullivan had a standout performance with an interception, a sack, and six tackles. True freshman safety Jayden Sanders stepped up in the absence of Zeke Berry, recording eight tackles and solid coverage on crucial third downs. \nMaize n Brew\n\nNebraska's quarterback Dylan Raiola threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns, connecting with Jacory Barney Jr. for two scores. Running back Emmett Johnson added 67 rushing yards, but the Huskers' offense struggled to establish a consistent ground game, totaling just 43 rushing yards. \nWikipedia\n\nThe game featured dramatic momentum swings. After trailing 10–0, Nebraska rallied to tie the game at 17–17 by halftime, highlighted by a 52-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass from Raiola to Barney Jr. However, Michigan's second-half scoring, including a 56-yard field goal and a 54-yard touchdown run, proved decisive. \n\nMichigan's victory extended its winning streak against Nebraska to five games and improved its all-time series lead to 9–4–1. The Wolverines also secured their sixth consecutive win in a Big Ten opener. \nUniversity of Michigan Athletics\n\nNebraska will look to rebound in its next conference matchup, aiming to build on the resilience shown in a hard-fought game against a ranked opponent.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Dani Busboom Kelly's Era at Nebraska Starts with Big Wins with Laney Choboy Shining at Libero",
        "description": "LINCOLN, Neb. — The Dani Busboom Kelly era of Nebraska volleyball is off to a dominant start. The Huskers opened the season with back-to-back wins over top-six opponents (3. Pittsburgh and 6. Stanford), and another top-10 challenge looms with No. 7 Kentucky next.\n\nThe early success has come with an emphasis on defense and chemistry. Players say the support within the team has been just as important as the competition.\n\n“Yes, we push each other every day — every practice is a battle,” freshman outsider hitter Teraya Sigler said. “But we are also so happy for each other and willing to support each other in whatever that looks like. Everyone is all in with wanting to be the best teammates they can.”\n\nThat buy-in has been especially evident at libero, a position that has produced some of Nebraska’s most iconic names, including Busboom Kelly herself. This fall, sophomore Laney Choboy has stepped into the role vacated by All-American Lexi Rodriguez.\n\nChoboy said her growth has been as much mental as physical. “It wasn’t really my skill that improved, it was my mentality,” she said. “What I was going to let affect me, what I was going to let into my body and my heart. The mental side made the biggest difference.”\n\nShe acknowledged the challenge of following Rodriguez, but said she has embraced it. “I learned from Lexi and will continue to use her as a resource, but I’m also my own player,” Choboy said. “I can do this. While I’m stepping into the role she left behind, I’m coming into it on my own.”\n\nCarrying the libero torch is not lost on Choboy, who called it a dream come true. “Nebraska has a legacy of big-time liberos,” she said. “Justine and Lexi going on to the Olympics — it’s insane to think I’m in this position now. I’m just grateful to be here and hope to carry on that legacy.”\n\nBusboom Kelly said her team is embracing the challenges ahead, including Kentucky.\n\n“I’m excited to play Kentucky,” she said. “This weekend was a challenge, and Kentucky has the talent to be a team in December that makes it all the way, in my opinion. It’ll be a heck of a challenge for us.”\n\nWith Busboom Kelly at the helm, Nebraska’s start to 2025 already looks like the foundation for another historic run.\n\n#HuskerVolleyball #NebraskaVolleyball #2025Season #Huskers #ncaavolleyball  #avca #terayasigler",

        "description": "Nebraska football coach Matt Rhule says his team is ready for a big-time matchup against the 4-1 Maryland Terrapins this weekend. The Huskers, also 4-1, will travel to face Maryland.\n\n“They respect the heck out of the team that we’re facing,” Rhule said during his weekly press conference on Thursday. “They know the battle that it’s going to be. That’s the message, and our guys have gotten that loud and clear.”\n\nRule confirmed that defensive back Malcolm Hartzog Jr. is doubtful and likely will not travel with the team. With a Northeaster expected to impact the East Coast, Nebraska practiced with wet footballs all week to prepare for potential rainy conditions.\n\nNebraska’s defense has been a key strength this season. Against Michigan State last week, the Huskers recorded five sacks and 14 quarterback hurries, consistently pressuring the pocket. Maryland’s true freshman quarterback, Malik Washington, has passed for 1,257 yards with nine touchdowns and two interceptions. Rhule described Washington as a dual-threat player, but Nebraska boasts the nation’s top-ranked pass defense, allowing just 90 yards per game.\n\n“With the possibility of rain, the passing game may not see much action,” Rhule said. “That means our front seven have to step up and create the energy.\"\n\nThe Huskers’ offense also faces pressure. Quarterback Dylan Raiola has been sacked 12 times over the past two games — seven against Michigan and five against Michigan State. \n\nRhule emphasized that not all of the responsibility lies with the offensive line, but they know improvement is needed. Protecting Raiola will be crucial for Nebraska’s offense, which ranks eighth nationally at 320 yards per game.\n\nKick off is Saturday at 2:30 p.m. Central.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "description": "The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission Board convened Tuesday despite the recent resignations of members Bruce Bailey and Kim Lowe, who stepped down at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen. The resignations followed the indictment of Hobert Rupe, executive director of the Liquor Control Commission, on seven charges. Prosecutors allege Rupe provided favors to a Lincoln strip club owner in exchange for cash, dances, and sexual favors. The reasons behind Bailey and Lowe's resignations remain unclear, but Gov. Pillen expressed gratitude for their service, stating, \"I appreciate the willingness of Bruce and Kim to serve, and I thank them for the time they have been on the commission.\"\n\nBy law, members of the Liquor Control Commission also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission. Gov. Pillen is currently accepting applications to fill the vacancies and will appoint two new members. The board faced an October 1 deadline to approve the state's four cannabis cultivators and release permanent regulations. Monica Oldenburg confirmed that one task has been completed: \"The emergency regulations approved at the September 8 meeting have been approved and signed by the governor and are in full force and in effect until 11:59 p.m. on December 7, at which time they will expire unless extended for a second 90-day period.\"\n\nDespite receiving 39 cultivator applications, the board could not select the four cultivators. An evaluation team, which included Bailey and Lowe, was tasked with reviewing the applications. The commission intended for the team to provide licensure recommendations at Tuesday's meeting. Lorelle Mueting emphasized the board's commitment to resolving the issue, saying, \"We just ask, I guess, for your understanding that this is a situation that none of us created and this is where we’re at right here. We hope you understand that we’re working through this the best we can to get the licenses issued in a timely manner.\"\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/nebraska-cannabis-board-faces-delays-after-resignations-and-legal-charges#",

        "title": "Huskers Show Grit in 28–21 Win over Northwestern, Bounce Back from Minnesota Loss",
        "description": "Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule pushed back on the idea that the Huskers lost focus in preparation for last week’s loss at Minnesota, saying his team “did not take our feet off the gas pedal” as they now turn their attention to Northwestern.\n\nThe response came after tight end Luke Lindemeier said Tuesday that Nebraska lost focus in the week leading up to the 24–6 setback in Minneapolis. Rhule disagreed, emphasizing that both last week and this week have featured strong practices.\n\n“I thought we had a great week of work,” Rhule said. “Our guys haven’t taken their foot off the gas.”\n\nNebraska will need that urgency against a Northwestern offense built on a physical ground game. The Wildcats are averaging 190 rushing yards per game, sixth best in the Big Ten. Rhule praised Northwestern’s offensive front and explosive running backs.\n\n“They’re unbelievably well-coached up front,” Rhule said. “Their backs have great bursts and they’re as athletic as we’ll see. They have home-run ability.”\n\nThe matchup puts pressure on a Nebraska defense ranked 15th in the Big Ten in rushing defense, allowing 157 yards per game. However, if the Huskers can keep the Wildcats behind the sticks, the advantage flips. Nebraska owns the nation’s top-ranked pass defense, while Northwestern enters with the No. 112 passing offense.\n\n“You can’t let 1st-and-10 become 2nd-and-5,” Rhule said. “It’s going to come down to our ability to get off blocks and make tackles.”\n\nNebraska received mixed injury news entering the weekend. Starting right guard Rocco Spindler, who left the Minnesota game with a finger injury, is expected to play. Rhule called the decision a matter of pain tolerance and said Spindler practiced all week. “He’s a baller,” Rhule said.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, defensive back Malcolm Hartzog will miss the remainder of the season. He will redshirt after undergoing surgery for a core-muscle injury.\n\nNebraska (5–2, 2–2 Big Ten) and Northwestern (5–2, 3–1) kick off at 11 a.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium.\n\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Matt Rhule Press Conference for Houston Christian | Nebraska Football Presser",
        "description": "LINCOLN — Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule opened his end-of-week press conference with reflection and perspective as the Huskers turn their attention to Houston Christian.\n\nRhule said the team visited the 9/11 Memorial before their bowl game in New York last season, an experience he believes gave players valuable perspective. “It’s important to remind them what it means, to encourage our guys to tell people you love them,” Rhule said. He also congratulated Nebraska’s newest Hall of Fame inductees, highlighting Brett Maher’s rare achievement of earning All-Big Ten honors as both a punter and kicker.\n\nRhule shared his own memories of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was a coach at UCLA. “I remember the helpless feeling of being in Los Angeles, watching it in the facilities,” he said. With a family member who died in a plane crash, Rhule said the tragedy hit close to home. He emphasized the importance of bringing those stories to life for players who weren’t yet born.\n\nLooking ahead, Rhule stressed this week is about improvement. “If we don’t play better than we played last week, then we didn’t play better,” he said. The coach added that he was pleased with practice and with a recent video the program released, saying it set the standard he expects.\n\nRhule also weighed in on the NCAA transfer portal, questioning why it doesn’t align with the financial year. “Why don’t we just do what the NFL does? They’re doing so well,” he said.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola continues to be a focal point, with Saturday marking his 16th career game. “He’s still so young in his journey, but he’s doing it at such an advanced level,” Rhule said. “He’s at level four now with his understanding. We’ve elevated what we do with him, and he’s taken it to a whole other level.”\n\nHouston Christian’s defense presents challenges, Rhule added, noting they’ve allowed only one third-down conversion this season while constantly showing different looks. “We have to do a better job getting to the quarterback,” he said.\n\nRhule also praised left tackle Gunnar Gottula, calling him “an excellent player with long arms and toughness” who has returned even stronger from surgery. Meanwhile, cornerback Malcolm Hartzog is questionable this week, meaning Jamir Conn could see more playing time.\n\nNebraska (2-0) will host Houston Christian (1-1) at Memorial Stadium on Saturday. Kickoff is set for 11 a.m. CT.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "description": "Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule reflected on his team’s 20-17 win over Cincinnati and looked ahead to Saturday’s home opener against Akron during his weekly press conference on Monday.\n\nRhule said he is eager to return to Memorial Stadium for a night game.\n\n“Obviously, we’re excited to come back home, play at home this week versus Akron,” Rhule said. “Joe Moorhead is a coach I have a long history with and a lot of respect for.”\n\nThe Huskers will be without tight end Janiran Bonner, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL. Rhule described Bonner as a “selfless teammate” who has meant a great deal to the program.\n\nDefensively, Nebraska gave up more than 200 rushing yards against the Bearcats, with 96 of those yards coming from quarterback runs. Rhule admitted the Huskers struggled with containment.\n\n“Anytime you give up 200 yards rushing, you’re not gonna be real happy,” Rhule said. “I don’t know if we did a good enough job as coaches of getting our players ready.”\n\nStill, Rhule credited his secondary for limiting Cincinnati to just 69 yards through the air.\n\nOn offense, running back Emmett Johnson carried the load, something Rhule said he wasn’t completely comfortable with.\n\n“I wasn’t happy with it,” Rhule said. “I wanted to get Izaac and Mekhi in, but Emmett was hot. We went with Emmett.”\n\nRhule praised quarterback Dylan Raiola, who threw 42 passes without a turnover.\n\n“He has more freedom than most quarterbacks in the country, and he’s right most of the time,” Rhule said. “So I thought he played excellent.”\n\nRhule also confirmed Raiola is healthy after appearing with ice on his hand after the Cincinnati game. “He took a hit in the game. He threw on Sunday. You’ll see him playing against Akron,” Rhule said.\n\nNebraska didn’t return from Kansas City until 4 a.m. Friday, altering the team’s weekly schedule. The Huskers skipped weight training that day, instead reviewing film in the afternoon. Players rested on Saturday before returning to film review and practice on Sunday.\n\nNebraska faces Akron on Saturday night at Memorial Stadium.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #danekey #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "description": "On a hot and windy afternoon at Barbara Hibner Field, the Nebraska women’s soccer team settled for a 1-1 draw against Missouri State in its second home match of the season.\n\nThe Huskers (1-0-1) dominated possession early, recording 20 shots in the game, but could not break through in the first half. Their best moment before the break came when goalkeeper CeCe Villa saved a Missouri State penalty, diving to her right to keep the score level.\n\nThe Bears (0-1-1) struck first in the second half, when Rowann Law scored with a left-footed strike less than 10 minutes after the restart.\n\nNebraska responded quickly. Ella Rudney equalized with a long-range shot that flew into the top corner, bringing the home crowd to its feet.\n\nBoth teams had chances to find a winner in the closing minutes, but Missouri State goalkeeper Ella Becker stood strong, making multiple saves to deny the Huskers.\n\nHead coach John Walker said his team struggled with execution in the heat and wind.\n\n“We gave up a goal and at least came back into the game and had some very good chances down the stretch,” Walker said. “At the end of the day, from a result standpoint, this is a game that we need to win.”\n\nNebraska travels to Oklahoma State on Aug. 21 before returning home to face Weber State on Aug. 28.",

The 22-year-old registered Democrat recently testified against the McCook Immigration Detention Facility at a hearing, criticizing the governor's approach.\n\n\"I think it's wrong and I think the governor is using it as a way to distract from his failing leadership and the rest of the Republican Party's failing leadership in the state,\" said Ostdiek. \"They’ve decided to bully immigrants and really demonize a lot of people instead of actually addressing the problems that Nebraskans are facing.\"\n\nOstdiek emphasized the importance of transparency in his campaign. \"I've always been active in legislature for the last several years since I became civically engaged. I've talked to numerous other bills and shown up to testify,\" he said.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/political-newcomer-nate-ostdiek-launches-campaign-for-nebraska-senate-seat#",

        "title": "Matt Rhule Shares Thughts on 9/11 and Previews Match up vs. HCU",
        "description": "LINCOLN — Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule opened his end-of-week press conference with reflection and perspective as the Huskers turn their attention to Houston Christian.\n\nRhule said the team visited the 9/11 Memorial before their bowl game in New York last season, an experience he believes gave players valuable perspective. “It’s important to remind them what it means, to encourage our guys to tell people you love them,” Rhule said. He also congratulated Nebraska’s newest Hall of Fame inductees, highlighting Brett Maher’s rare achievement of earning All-Big Ten honors as both a punter and kicker.\n\nRhule shared his own memories of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was a coach at UCLA. “I remember the helpless feeling of being in Los Angeles, watching it in the facilities,” he said. With a family member who died in a plane crash, Rhule said the tragedy hit close to home. He emphasized the importance of bringing those stories to life for players who weren’t yet born.\n\nLooking ahead, Rhule stressed this week is about improvement. “If we don’t play better than we played last week, then we didn’t play better,” he said. The coach added that he was pleased with practice and with a recent video the program released, saying it set the standard he expects.\n\nRhule also weighed in on the NCAA transfer portal, questioning why it doesn’t align with the financial year. “Why don’t we just do what the NFL does? They’re doing so well,” he said.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola continues to be a focal point, with Saturday marking his 16th career game. “He’s still so young in his journey, but he’s doing it at such an advanced level,” Rhule said. “He’s at level four now with his understanding. We’ve elevated what we do with him, and he’s taken it to a whole other level.”\n\nHouston Christian’s defense presents challenges, Rhule added, noting they’ve allowed only one third-down conversion this season while constantly showing different looks. “We have to do a better job getting to the quarterback,” he said.\n\nRhule also praised left tackle Gunnar Gottula, calling him “an excellent player with long arms and toughness” who has returned even stronger from surgery. Meanwhile, cornerback Malcolm Hartzog is questionable this week, meaning Jamir Conn could see more playing time.\n\nNebraska (2-0) will host Houston Christian (1-1) at Memorial Stadium on Saturday. Kickoff is set for 11 a.m. CT.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "description": "LINCOLN, Neb. — Nebraska volleyball is no stranger to reloading, whether through transfers or freshmen ready to contribute from day one. This fall, one of the brightest early storylines belongs to true freshman Teraya Sigler.\n\nSigler, the nation’s No. 1 overall recruit out of Horizon High School in Arizona, started Nebraska’s opening weekend matches against No. 3 Pittsburgh and No. 6 Stanford. A two-time Gatorade Arizona Player of the Year and a gold medalist with the U.S. U21 and U19 national teams, she entered Lincoln with a decorated resume and quickly found herself on the court under the sport’s brightest lights.\n\n“The first five points I was kind of like, ‘Where am I? What am I doing?’” Sigler said. “Then my teammates reminded me we’re just playing volleyball. It’s just a big game in a big arena with a lot of people.”\n\nSigler, typically an outside hitter, has been adjusting to a new role to fit Nebraska’s lineup needs. She notched one kill against both Pittsburgh and Stanford, and added a service ace against the Cardinal. While her stat line was modest, her energy and composure drew praise from coaches and teammates alike.\n\n“I love to help this team however they need me,” Sigler said. “I see it as an opportunity to prove myself and be the best I possibly can in that position.”\n\nNebraska has leaned on freshmen before — setter Bergen Reilly started last year en route to All-America honors, while Harper Murray and Andi Jackson each made early impacts. Sigler now joins that list, showing confidence that belies her age.\n\nFor coach Dani Busboom Kelly, Sigler’s presence on the court has already made a difference. “Her energy was so much fun,” Busboom Kelly said. “Whether she’s in the game or coming off for a rotation, she brings the same perspective and vibes.”\n\nWith her debut behind her, Sigler appears poised to grow into her role as the season continues. In front of more than 16,000 fans at Pinnacle Bank Arena, she showed the nerves didn’t last long.\n\nShe’s used to the spotlight, and Nebraska believes she’s ready to shine in it again.\n\n#HuskerVolleyball #NebraskaVolleyball #2025Season #Huskers #ncaavolleyball  #avca #terayasigler",

        "title": "LPD investigate murder-suicide amid domestic violence concerns.",
        "description": "The Lincoln Police Department is investigating a murder-suicide after discovering a couple deceased inside a home. 51-year-old Jennifer McCarther, a mother of three and grandmother to five, was found with multiple gunshot wounds, while 51-year-old Sterling Jordan had a single gunshot wound to the head. Autopsies are pending to confirm the time, manner, and cause of death.\n\nLPD Chief Michon Morrow stated that officers responded to a welfare check around 10:45 a.m. Friday, where they found McCarther and Jordan deceased. Jordan's employer had called for a welfare check the previous day when he did not report to work. Officers initially did not force entry due to the routine nature of welfare checks. However, a second call prompted further investigation, leading to the discovery.\n\nThis marks the third serious domestic violence case in Lincoln in 2025. Leah Dorge from Friendship Home noted an increase in the number of people seeking shelter and housing services, with an average of 167 people daily, a number that has tripled over the last decade.

        "description": "The Elwood Hometown Cooperative Market closed it's doors for the final time in March of this year, to the dismay of many residents. Now, the Center for Rural Affairs is investigating the factors behind the shutdown and exploring ways to ensure the availability of grocery stores in rural areas.\n\n\"It's incredibly difficult to own and operate a grocery store in a rural place, and it can also be difficult for rural grocery stores to have the purchasing power of larger competitors, such as a Dollar General or a Walmart,\" said Audra Espinoza, state policy manager for the Center for Rural Affairs.\n\nResidents of Elwood, along with local grocers, a legislative aide, and other concerned parties gathered to share their experiences and discuss adaptations following the store's closure. Many now face a nearly half-hour drive to Lexington or rely on deliveries from Walmart.\n\nTo read more visit: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/elwood-residents-seek-solutions-after-grocery-store-closure#",

        "description": "Two livestock markets in central Nebraska saw record-breaking feeder cattle prices last week. This a sign of long-awaited relief for ranchers and sale barn operators who’ve endured years of tight margins.\n\nRick Shoemaker, owner of Huss and Lexington Livestock Markets, said business is thriving as demand outpaces supply and more buyers show up ready to bid.\n\n“It’s a great time to be running a sale barn,” said Shoemaker. “You don’t have to worry about starting them cattle and worry about someone not betting... The cattle industry —it’s a big boost for them and they’ve been needing it.”\n\nCorey Cline, a bonded cattle dealer, echoed that sentiment. He said the recent surge is especially good news for producers across Nebraska and beyond who are finally seeing strong returns.\n\n“It makes me feel really good for all the producers out here in Nebraska and all over the country that’s finally cashing in on some really good markets,” said Cline.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/two-sale-barns-set-record-breaking-feeder-cattle-prices",

        "description": "Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule pushed back on the idea that the Huskers lost focus in preparation for last week’s loss at Minnesota, saying his team “did not take our feet off the gas pedal” as they now turn their attention to Northwestern.\n\nThe response came after tight end Luke Lindemeier said Tuesday that Nebraska lost focus in the week leading up to the 24–6 setback in Minneapolis. Rhule disagreed, emphasizing that both last week and this week have featured strong practices.\n\n“I thought we had a great week of work,” Rhule said. “Our guys haven’t taken their foot off the gas.”\n\nNebraska will need that urgency against a Northwestern offense built on a physical ground game. The Wildcats are averaging 190 rushing yards per game, sixth best in the Big Ten. Rhule praised Northwestern’s offensive front and explosive running backs.\n\n“They’re unbelievably well-coached up front,” Rhule said. “Their backs have great bursts and they’re as athletic as we’ll see. They have home-run ability.”\n\nThe matchup puts pressure on a Nebraska defense ranked 15th in the Big Ten in rushing defense, allowing 157 yards per game. However, if the Huskers can keep the Wildcats behind the sticks, the advantage flips. Nebraska owns the nation’s top-ranked pass defense, while Northwestern enters with the No. 112 passing offense.\n\n“You can’t let 1st-and-10 become 2nd-and-5,” Rhule said. “It’s going to come down to our ability to get off blocks and make tackles.”\n\nNebraska received mixed injury news entering the weekend. Starting right guard Rocco Spindler, who left the Minnesota game with a finger injury, is expected to play. Rhule called the decision a matter of pain tolerance and said Spindler practiced all week. “He’s a baller,” Rhule said.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, defensive back Malcolm Hartzog will miss the remainder of the season. He will redshirt after undergoing surgery for a core-muscle injury.\n\nNebraska (5–2, 2–2 Big Ten) and Northwestern (5–2, 3–1) kick off at 11 a.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium.",

        "description": "Nebraska coach Matt Rhule wants his team to carry a “killer instinct” into Saturday’s game against Houston Christian.\n\nPreviewing the matchup with the FCS opponent, Rhule pointed to another Nebraskan chasing history this weekend — Omaha native Terence “Bud” Crawford. The boxer is moving up multiple weight classes to face Canelo Álvarez in a bid to become the first male unified champion in three different divisions.\n\n“Don’t just sit there and hope that you get accolades,” Rhule said. “Risk it all. Risk it all to be great.”\n\nRhule said that mindset is what he wants from the Huskers all season. He emphasized playing a full 60 minutes and not letting an opponent gain life.\n\n“You put away the people you’re supposed to put away,” Rhule said. “They’re supposed to walk up to their A.D. and be like, ‘Don’t schedule them again.’ That’s the mentality we’re supposed to have.”\n\nRhule reported no new injuries for Nebraska, noting his team remains healthy entering Week 3. While Houston Christian (1-1) is an FCS program, Rhule said the Huskers won’t overlook them.\n\n“They’re from Texas. They have quality players, good schemes, great coaching,” Rhule said. “So we’re looking for the same 60 minutes of competition this week as well.”\n\nNebraska routed Akron 68-0 last week, its highest-scoring game since 2012. Rhule said he expects the Huskers to show the same energy against the Huskies.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "title": "Exclusive John Cook Interview Moments After Statue Revealed!",
        "description": "Former Nebraska volleyball coach John Cook said it felt “a little bit eerie” to see his newly unveiled bronze statue outside the Devaney Sports Center, but he credited the moment more to the program’s legacy than to himself.\n\n“It’s so well done. I really admire the artists that do this,” Cook said, referencing world-renowned sculptor George Lundeen. “It really doesn’t mean all that much for me. It’s more about Nebraska volleyball and all that we’ve done here.  Nebraska’s the epicenter of volleyball in this country, and I think this is just a symbol of that.”\n\nCook announced his retirement on Jan. 29, 2025, after 25 seasons as Nebraska's head coach. Overall, Cook spent 32 years as a college head coach - seven at Wisconsin and 25 at Nebraska. He won four NCAA championships leading the Huskers.\n\nCook is the first non-football coach to receive a statue. He joins legendary football coaches Tom Osborne and Bob Devaney as the third Nebraska coach immortalized with a statue. Cook said Osborne called him the day before the unveiling.\n\n“He always downplays it so much, that’s the way he is,” Cook said. “But for me personally, he was one of my role models here. He was also the athletic director for four or five years and really helped me with the move to Devaney. To be recognized along with him means a lot.”\n\nCook also praised his successor, Dani Busboom Kelly, who took over the program this season.\n\n“To me, it’s the greatest achievement of my coaching career — to be able to hire a coach from Nebraska who played here, coached here, and won national championships, and then to come back as the head coach,” Cook said. “To me, it’s my greatest accomplishment.”\n\nNow living full-time in Wyoming, Cook said he enjoys life away from coaching but still feels a strong connection to the sport.\n\n“I love it. I can’t tell you how much I love it,” Cook said. “I’ve been back and forth because of things like this and doing some TV matches, which I really enjoy. It helps keep me a part of it.”\n\nCook recently sat on the other side of the camera, interviewing Busboom Kelly for a broadcast. He said the role came naturally.\n\n“I’m not going to be your typical color analyst or interviewer because I know Dani,” Cook said. “I feel comfortable in asking her almost anything I wanted to try to get some more out of her for the fans to understand what it’s like to coach and how she feels. It was awesome.”\n\nSpeakers at the event included University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold, Nebraska Director of Athletics Troy Dannen, Nebraska Volleyball Head Coach Dani Busboom Kelly, and Cook himself.\n\nAfter taking over the program in 2000, Cook guided the Huskers to four national championships, 12 NCAA Semifinal appearances, nine Big 12 titles, and five Big Ten titles. He achieved a career record of 883-176 (.834), the fifth-best winning percentage all-time for a Division I volleyball coach. Cook's record of 722-103 at Nebraska was the best winning percentage (.875) for any DI program from 2000-24.\n\nWith Cook at the helm, Nebraska produced numerous individual honors, including five Olympians, a Honda-Broderick Cup winner, three AVCA Division I National Players of the Year, 72 AVCA All-Americans, three Academic All-Americans of the Year, 25 Academic All-Americans, and 10 conference players of the year. Nebraska volleyball student-athletes combined for 88 all-conference awards and 155 academic all-conference honors in Cook's program.",

        "title": "Huskers Turn to True Freshman QB TJ Lateef after Dylan Raiola Injury Ahead of UCLA Matchup",
        "description": "Nebraska will have to find a way to avoid back-to-back losses without its starting quarterback.\n\nHead coach Matt Rhule confirmed Monday that sophomore quarterback Dylan Raiola is out for the season with a broken fibula. Raiola, who started 22 straight games in his Nebraska career, will undergo surgery this week.\n\n“It’s not like it’s a ‘battle your way through it’ type deal,” Rhule said. “He’s going to have a chance for once to sit there and watch and learn. I know he’ll be involved in game planning and ideas, and he’ll rally around TJ.”\n\nRaiola finishes the season with 2,000 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and six interceptions through nine games.\n\nTrue freshman TJ Lateef will step in as Nebraska’s new starting quarterback. Lateef saw limited action in blowout wins earlier this season against Akron and Houston Christian.\n\n“He’s really smart, always on time, knows the progressions, knows the checks — you can trust him in those things,” Rhule said. “He’s got amazing arm talent. He can spin it, he can run, he can move. He’s an excellent player, and I think everyone’s going to see him play really, really well.”\n\nThe start will be a homecoming for Lateef and five other Huskers who grew up in California. Nebraska travels to Pasadena to face UCLA under the lights at the Rose Bowl in primetime.\n\nRhule said UCLA, now 3-5, looks much improved after a midseason coaching change that elevated offensive coordinator Jerry Neuheisel to interim head coach.\n\n“It’s really a tale of two seasons,” Rhule said. “You take out the first part of the year — they’re 3-2 in the Big Ten under Coach Skipper. They’ve got things rolling, so it’ll be an unbelievable battle, an unbelievable challenge.”\n\nAnother injury concern for Nebraska is offensive lineman Elijah Pritchett, who left the USC game early. Rhule said his status for UCLA will be a game-time decision, depending on pain tolerance.\n\n#nebraskafootball #cornhuskers #huskers #gobigred #dylanraiola #mattrhule #tjlateef",

Originally found in eastern states like Iowa and Minnesota, tar spot has gradually moved westward, with recent reports from Buffalo, Dawson and Custer counties.\n\nKatelyn Duffy, CPI Precision Agronomy manager, highlighted the significance of the discovery. \"We were the first to be able to identify tar spot [in the area] and also send it in for confirmation.

Though they’ve already played away from Lincoln once — a win over Cincinnati in Kansas City — head coach Matt Rhule said that game felt more like a home contest. To prepare for the long trip to the East Coast, Rhule said Nebraska is adjusting its typical travel schedule.\n\n“We’re not a big Thursday operation,” Rhule said. “We like to go on Fridays and keep our routine, but this is one time and the only time this year that we’ll go out on Thursday, just because of the nature of being on the East Coast.”\n\nThe Huskers’ defense will be tested by Maryland’s freshman quarterback Malik Washington, a former five-star recruit known for his ability to throw deep and extend plays. Washington has helped lead an offense averaging 31 points per game, with 257 yards passing and 93 yards rushing. “They can run the football, but their passing game has really opened up,” Rhule said. “We’re a pretty good pass defense, so it should be a good matchup.”\n\nNebraska’s offense continues to find balance behind quarterback Dylan Raiola. The Huskers are averaging 320 passing yards and 130 rushing yards per game. Both teams have excelled at protecting the football — Nebraska is plus-six in turnover margin this season, while Maryland sits at plus-seven.\n\n“I’d rather be plus-one every game than plus-six on the year,” Rhule said. “That gives you a chance to win.”\n\nRhule also highlighted several defensive standouts from the Michigan State game, including Elijah Jeudy’s first career sack and Deshaun Singleton’s two interceptions in the second quarter. “It’s one thing to not give the ball away, which we’re doing a pretty good job of,” Rhule said. “But we’re also taking it away — that’s playmakers stepping up.”\n\nOn the injury front, cornerback Malcolm Hartzog remains questionable after trying to test things out pregame last week. Rhule said Hartzog would be an ideal player to have against Maryland’s high-powered passing attack, but his status will be clearer after Tuesday’s practice. \n\nNebraska and Maryland kick off Saturday in College Park at 2:30 PM CST, with both teams looking to stay in the hunt near the top of the Big Ten standings.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Nebraska Prepares for Prime-time Showdown with No. 23 USC as Rhule Signs Contract Extension",
        "description": "The biggest news in college football on Thursday came out of Lincoln, where Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule signed a contract extension to remain with the Cornhuskers through 2032.\n\nAfter finalizing the deal, Rhule quickly shifted focus to Saturday’s showdown against No. 23 USC at Memorial Stadium. The Huskers are looking to end a lengthy drought — they’re 0–28 against AP Top 25 teams since 2016.\n\n“We’re playing a team this week coming off a bye, so you know you’re a little banged up, they’re fresh,” Rhule said. “You better be dialed in — and they’ve been dialed in all week.”\n\nRhule’s extension, which he called a move about “stability,” sends a clear message of commitment to fans, players, and recruits.\n\n“I want to give this team everything I have and not be distracted with anything else,” Rhule said. “When they were able to get it done, we were able to get it done.”\n\nNebraska enters the weekend 6–2, its best eight-game start in nine years, but faces its toughest test yet. USC leads the Big Ten in total offense, averaging more than 530 yards and 42 points per game.\n\nThe Huskers counter with one of the league’s top pass defenses, ranking second in the conference, but will be challenged by Trojan quarterback Jayden Maiava, who has thrown for more than 2,100 yards and 19 touchdowns for the 5–2 Trojans.\n\nOn offense, Nebraska sophomore Dylan Raiola has tossed 17 touchdowns this season, while running back Emmett Johnson has surpassed 1,000 yards from scrimmage in just eight games.\n\nSpecial teams could be a difference-maker. Nebraska leads the Big Ten and ranks third nationally in kickoff returns, averaging 32 yards per return. USC, meanwhile, ranks near the bottom of the nation in kick coverage, allowing 28 yards per return.\n\nGame-time temperatures are expected to hover around 45 degrees at kickoff, with wind chills in the 30s — conditions Rhule says his team is embracing.\n\nKickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. Saturday, November 1.\n\n#GBR #Huskers #MattRhule #NebraskaFootball #HuskerSports\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #nebraskafootball",

        "description": "Nebraska football faces a critical test Saturday night in prime time when No. 23 USC visits Memorial Stadium in a matchup that could determine the Huskers’ postseason hopes.\n\nThe 6-2 Cornhuskers enter the game with their College Football Playoff aspirations still alive, while a loss would in all likelihood end their chances. Coach Matt Rhule said the team is focused on finishing games, not just competing.\n\n“I always want to come down the stretch of every year with a chance to make it in the College Football Playoff,” Rule said during his weekly Monday press conference. “The entire focus this week is finishing, not just competing.”\n\nNebraska’s recent struggles include allowing Northwestern to come back from a 15-point deficit. Rhule emphasized the importance of closing out games when holding a lead.\n\nOn defense, the Huskers face a potent 5-2 USC offense led by quarterback Jayden Maiava, who excels at both passing and running the zone read. Rule, who has coached against USC coach Lincoln Riley at Temple and Baylor before last year's matchup, called him a “brilliant offensive mind” who will find ways to score.\n\nThe Nebraska game plan will rely on discipline, physicality, and tackling in space. Offensively, the Huskers aim to lean on running back Emmitt Johnson, who ranks second in the Big Ten with 837 rushing yards and leads the conference with 1,019 all-purpose yards. Johnson is the only Big Ten player this season to surpass 1,000 all-purpose yards.\n\nSaturday night’s game will feature the Huskers in blackout uniforms, with Rhule noting the crowd at Memorial Stadium as a distinct advantage. “It’s truly a true 12th man,” he said. “But again, it’s going to come down to blocking and tackling.”\n\n\nInjury news for Nebraska includes starting right tackle Teddy Prochazka, who will miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL. Porhaska also missed last year due to injury.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

The quality of play dropped from the ones to the twos to the threes, and I don’t like that.”\n\nStill, Rhule described the day as a “very successful” close to camp, noting the team is beginning to gel ahead of its Aug. 28 matchup against Cincinnati at Arrowhead Stadium.",

        "description": "Top-ranked Nebraska opened Big Ten play with a sweep of Michigan on Sunday, improving to 11-0 with a 25-22, 25-10, 25-13 victory at the Bob Devaney Sports Center.\n\nThe Huskers, who entered the match unbeaten, controlled both sides of the ball after weathering an early surge from the Wolverines. Nebraska finished with 47 kills compared to Michigan’s 24, adding five service aces and 12 blocks.\n\nSetter Bergen Reilly tallied 28 assists and moved into fifth place on Nebraska’s all-time assists list in the rally-scoring era, passing her head coach, Dani Busboom Kelly.\n\n“Being a setter at Nebraska is such an honor, and it’s something that I’ll never forget,” Reilly said. “I hope I’m only getting started too.”\n\nBusboom Kelly praised her team’s composure after Michigan opened with energy. “I thought we played really well. Michigan came out blazing, but we stayed composed and forced a momentum shift,” she said. “It was just an overall really good performance on both sides of the ball.”\n\nFreshman outside hitter Virginia Adriano added offensive firepower, hitting over .400 for the match, while libero Olivia Mauch anchored the back row with steady passing and out-of-system setting.\n\n“It was a good, complete game by her,” Busboom Kelly said of Mauch, who has started at libero after taking over the position from Laney Choboy.\n\nThe Huskers stay at home for their next match when they host Maryland Saturday at 3 p.m. CST.\n\n🔴⚪ Subscribe for more Husker coverage and highlights!\n\n#NebraskaVolleyball #Huskers #GBR #Volleyball #gobigred #huskersvolleyball #devaneycenter #danibussboomkelly  #bergenreilly  #harpermurray",

        "description": "Nebraska's All-American Setter Bergen Reilly says the Huskers’ offense is finding its rhythm as the team prepares for Utah this weekend.\n\n“I’ve been working on consistency with hitters, and it’s been a fun offense to run,” Reilly said. “Hopefully we can keep getting better and grow throughout the season.”\n\nReilly credited teammates for helping elevate her play, especially freshman setter Campbell. “She’s beyond her years,” Reilly said. “I’ve even learned from her. She sets with full confidence and no fear.”\n\nHead Coach Dani Busboom Kelly said she likes the progress her team has made, but passing remains an area for improvement.\n\n“Our passing has been solid, but there’s always room for growth,” Busboom Kelly said. “We don’t expect perfection, but we want them to play free and know they can fail. That’s how you get better.”\n\nBusboom Kelly emphasized the importance of enjoying wins rather than treating them with relief. “Whether it’s big or small, have fun and play free. The most important thing is what we’re doing right now,” she said.\n\n#22 Utah, Nebraska’s next opponent, brings challenges. The Utes are known for strong serving and boast one of the nation’s top outside hitters. “Utah’s a really good serving team,” Busboom Kelly said. “We have to be ready.”\n\nThe Huskers are 6-0 entering the matchup at the Devaney Center on Friday, September 9th. Saturday, September 10th, the Huskers host Grand Canyon.",

The senior from Hastings St. Cecilia knew from a young age she’d be destined for big things.\n\n“There is a memory I have, I went to my first-ever Nebraska game and said to my mom they’re really good at volleyball, I’m probably going to be good at volleyball,” said Payton Sullivan, St. Cecila senior.\n\nSullivan was right. The 6’1 senior middle has a .454 hitting percentage which ranks her second in all classes and first in class C.\n\n“She’s going to see four hands all the time, but because of her athleticism and how hard she works she knows how to swing high,” said St. Cecilia head coach Kelan Schumacher.\n\nSullivan’s hitting ability was on full display as the Wayne State commit garnered her 1000th career kill.\n\n“As a middle hitter its not super easy to get 1000 kills. She works so hard and its super impressive,” said Shumacher.\n\n“Since I was young, I’ve always wanted to be the best I can be, so I’ve put in a lot of hours in the gym plus the ability to be able to jump a little bit which helps me have better court vision,” said Sullivan.\n\nSullivan and her team are one win away from returning to the state playoffs.",

        "description": "Nebraska volleyball opens its season in historic fashion, playing its first-ever match at Pinnacle Bank Arena on  Friday in the AVCA First Serve Showcase. The top-ranked Huskers face a stiff test against No. 3 Pittsburgh, which is coming off a 33-2 season and its fourth straight NCAA semifinal appearance.\n\nThe Panthers return AVCA National Player of the Year Olivia Babcock and a roster that coach Dan Fisher has bolstered with new additions.\n\nNebraska enters a new era under first-year head coach Dani Busboom Kelly, who takes over after two decades under John Cook. Busboom Kelly is no stranger to Fisher, having faced him annually while coaching at Louisville.\n\n“I just think we made each other better,” Fisher said. “They exposed stuff that we didn’t see against some other teams, and I think we were able to do the same against them.”\n\nThe matchup is steeped in history, as Nebraska has won all 14 previous meetings against Pitt. But this time, the Panthers bring one of the nation’s toughest serving and grittiest defensive squads.\n\nNebraska players said the environment inside PBA feels like December volleyball.\n\n“A lot of us were saying it felt like we’re in December already, like it really feels like a Final Four environment, which is cool,” captain junior setter Bergen Reilly said. “We know the fans are going to bring it, so that’ll make it even better.”\n\nThe Huskers won’t get much of a break. On Sunday, they’ll face No. 6 Stanford in another top-10 showdown.\n\n“When you get to December, you’re only playing the best of the best,” Busboom Kelly said. “You have to challenge yourself. Might as well start early in the season and be prepared.”\n\n#HuskerVolleyball #NebraskaVolleyball #VolleyballCaptains #2025Season #Huskers #andijackson #bergrenreilly #rebekahallick #gobigred #gbr",

        "description": "John Cook’s legendary run with Nebraska volleyball ended last season in familiar fashion — deep in December, but just short of another title.\n\nThe four-time national champion retired after the Huskers fell to Penn State in the 2024 national semifinals. The Nittany Lions went on to defeat Louisville in the final under head coach Dani Busboom Kelly, who is now in her first season leading the Nebraska program.\n\nBusboom Kelly has the Huskers off to a 12-0 start, including 2-0 in Big Ten play, as they prepare for their first road test of the season: a trip to Penn State for the 13th match of the year.\n\nSenior captains Rebekah Allick and Bergen Reilly aren’t hiding what the matchup means.\n\n“I got a grudge, so I want to kick some butt,” Allick said. \n\n“Games like this always have implications for the postseason,\" Reilly said.\n\nAllick said consistency will be key against Penn State’s All-American Kennedy Martin.\n\n“First and second set, that kind of attack, they’re going to hit everything probably at full force,” she said. “But in the fourth and fifth set, if it goes long, you start to see tendencies and what hitters are most comfortable with.”\n\nReilly echoed the stakes.\n\n“We know what our goals are, and that’s a Big Ten championship and a national championship,” Reilly said. “Our offense has been flowing, and that allows me to be more aggressive. But we know Penn State is one of the loudest gyms in the country, and we have to be ready for that.”\n\nBusboom Kelly, who lost twice to Penn State last year with Louisville, said motivation won’t be an issue.\n\n“I’d say we’re pretty motivated,” she said. “It’s kind of a chip-on-our-shoulder week.”\n\nNebraska’s trip doesn’t end in State College. The Huskers head to Rutgers the following day, but for now, all eyes are on the rivalry match.\n\nFirst serve is scheduled for 7 p.m. Friday on FOX.\n\n🔴⚪ Subscribe for more Husker coverage and highlights!\n\n#NebraskaVolleyball #Huskers #GBR #Volleyball #gobigred #huskersvolleyball #devaneycenter #danibussboomkelly  #bergenreilly  #harpermurray",

        "description": "Matt Rhule met with the media ahead of Nebraska’s showdown with Michigan and said his team has worked hard through the first three games to be ready for the Big Ten grind. He praised Michigan’s offensive line as one of the nation’s best and said quarterback Bryce Underwood will face some of the same first-time challenges Dylan Raiola went through last year. Rhule called Raiola more than ready for the league, pointing to his leadership, ability to check into the right plays, and even sharing how after the Houston Christian game Raiola went home and texted him a video breaking down plays on a whiteboard.\n\nHe confirmed DBs like Malcolm Hartzog will be available after precautionary absences and said red zone struggles are a teaching point this week. He credited Nebraska’s offensive balance for avoiding three-and-outs in recent games and said practicing against Tony White’s defense has prepared Raiola for the pressure he’ll see from Michigan.\n\nRhule also described the atmosphere at the Terence Crawford fight in Las Vegas as the best sporting event he’s ever attended and reflected on how the team bonds around shared commitments. He closed by noting that non-conference games felt like preseason, but the Big Ten is here now and Nebraska has to prove itself against ranked opponents on national TV.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "description": "Nebraska football has two practices left in Lincoln, including one today, before opening its season Thursday night against Cincinnati at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.\n\nHead coach Matt Rhule will address the media following Tuesday’s practice, but Monday belonged to his coordinators. Both sides of the ball showed confidence while acknowledging the nerves that come with a season opener.\n\n“Jitters can be good,” offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen said. “It just means the guys are ready to go.”\n\nThe offensive line has drawn the most attention this camp, with Nebraska praising its depth and flexibility.\n\n“The rotation at tackle is something I’ve never had the luxury to do,” Holgorsen said. “Having five quality guys who can go out there and play is a huge advantage.”\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola, who is entering year two as the starter, said he feels prepared after a long camp and months of offseason work.\n\nAlthough Raiola has been to Arrowhead Stadium many times as a fan, he said Thursday’s stage will be different.\n\n“It’s a different mission — to go down there and win a football game,” Raiola said. “Obviously, my mindset will be different. The guys will be juiced up and ready to go.”\n\nRaiola, who has a friendship with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, even sought his advice on equipment for the game.\n\n“I asked Pat if I needed to wear seven-studded cleats,” Raiola said. “He said no — the field’s in perfect shape. Just play ball.”\n\nKickoff between Nebraska and Cincinnati is set for just after 8 p.m. Thursday at Arrowhead Stadium, with more than 74,000 fans expected in attendance.",

With just three Big Ten teams beginning their season over the past weekend, the Huskers collected three of the four awards.\n\nBergen Reilly was named Big Ten Setter of the Week for the 10th time in her career; Rebekah Allick was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week for the third time, and Virginia Adriano was chosen Big Ten Freshman of the Week for the first time.\n\nReilly had 10.86 assists per set and 2.71 digs per set in leading the Huskers to two top 10 wins over No. 3 Pitt and No. 6 Stanford. Reilly opened the season with a double-double of 40 assists and 10 digs in a 3-1 win against Pitt. She also had three blocks, one kill and one ace. The two-time Big Ten Setter of the Year followed up on Sunday with 36 assists and nine digs along with four kills and three blocks in a sweep of Stanford. Reilly set the Huskers to a .385 hitting percentage, Nebraska's best hitting percentage against a ranked team since 2016.\n\nAllick posted 1.71 blocks per set to go along with 2.86 kills per set and a .406 hitting percentage in the Huskers' two wins at the AVCA First Serve. She began the season with seven blocks and nine kills in the win against Pitt and recorded five more blocks with 11 kills on .600 hitting in the sweep of Stanford. Allick was named MVP of Sunday's match against the Cardinal and, along with libero Laney Choboy, was named to the AVCA All-First Serve Team on Tuesday.\n\nIn her first ever collegiate match against No. 3 Pitt, Adriano posted six kills and three blocks, which helped the Big Red hold Pitt to a .111 hitting percentage in the 3-1 Husker win.",

        "description": "Nebraska volleyball players Andi Jackson and Virginia Adriano talk with the media ahead of matchups with Illinois and Minnesota. Andi explains how the season feels long with so many upsets and how the level of play keeps rising. She says the team made strong adjustments after a slow first-set defensive start and felt connected on the court. Andi also talks about how Dani Busboom Kelly keeps the team grounded by celebrating daily wins while still focusing on long-term goals. She adds that having women’s volleyball featured on major platforms is huge for the sport.\n\nVirginia discusses how the Big Ten season feels more intense than Italy, but the two-match-per-week rhythm helps keep things smooth. She shares what it was like playing at Wisconsin, how she handled a slow start there, and how getting to know her teammates has helped build trust on the court. She also talks about international players becoming more common in college volleyball and how unique it is to experience high-level college sports compared to Italy. Virginia describes learning a new swing motion, traveling by charter instead of long bus rides, and how much land there is to cover in the U.S.\n\nBoth players reflect on serve strategy, including Brendan’s high volleyball IQ and the way he calls serves. They look ahead to the upcoming trip to Los Angeles, and Andi mentions she won’t be in town for high school championships but loves seeing those games played at the Bob.\n\n#HuskerVB #GBR #NebraskaVolleyball #DaniBussboomKelly #HuskerSportselly #HuskerSports",

        "description": "Hastings St. Cecilia captured its first state softball championship in school history, walking off No. 6 seed Central City in the bottom of the seventh to win the NSAA Class C title.\n\nThe top-seeded Bluehawks led most of the game before the Bison rallied in the top of the seventh to take a brief lead. But St. Cecilia stayed composed, setting the stage for Maddison Bauer, who delivered the game-winning hit.\n\n“I can’t lie, I was a little nervous, but I knew we were going to pull through,” Bauer said. “I knew I had to hit it because I didn’t want to let down my team. I love everyone so much, and they’ve always been there for me.”\n\nThe championship marked a milestone for the program and the school.\n\n“We made history,” senior pitcher Audrey Rossow, who earned the win, said. “We’ve never had a state championship for softball, so we’ll always be up there. It means so much right now.”\n\nHead coach Matt Rossow echoed the emotion.\n\n“Absolutely amazing,” Rossow said. “These girls fought for the kids who started going to state seven years ago. They just wanted to win one for the program.”\n\nPlayers and coaches credited the school community for helping push them across the finish line.\n\n“St. Cecilia fans, we appreciate the support,” Rossow said. “They helped us through.”\n\nNow, the team from Hastings will be remembered forever — as state champions.\n\n#hastings #hastingsstcecilia #nsaa #nebpreps #nebraskasoftball",

        "description": "Nebraska football coach Matt Rhule addressed national speculation linking him to the Penn State head coaching job during his press conference Monday to open Minnesota Week.\n\n“I love it here. It’s awesome,” Rhule said. “Troy [Dannen, Nebraska AD] and I are in constant, constant communication about this program and where we’re headed. You know, Troy and I understand the steps that you need to take to make us Big Ten champions and national champions. This place is elite.”\n\nRhule, a Penn State alumnus, said he has a deep respect for his alma mater and Athletic Director Pat Kraft, but emphasized his commitment to Nebraska and the program he is building in Lincoln.\n\nRhule is in the third year of an eight-year deal worth up to $74 million. He earns about $7.5 million this season and is set to make around $10 million annually at the peak of his contract. If Nebraska fires him, his buyout would be $49 million. If he leaves voluntarily, the buyout drops to $5 million this year and decreases by $1 million each subsequent year.\n\nLooking ahead, Rhule said his focus remains on Nebraska’s future, including a 2027 recruiting class currently ranked in the top ten nationally. “Players all across the country want to come here. We have the best facilities. We have elite fans. I’m really happy here and excited to get going this week on Minnesota,” he said.\n\nRhule also shared that his family is thriving in Lincoln. His wife is a local business owner, and their children enjoy school and the community. He said his decision to come to Nebraska was driven by two factors: the community and the opportunity to rebuild the program into a powerhouse.\n\nThis will be a developing story throughout the season.\n\n#GBR #Huskers #MattRhule #NebraskaFootball #HuskerSports\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

Hamel's life changed forever after a motorcycle accident left him paralyzed from the chest down. But his faith, family and the will to win has kept him in the fast lane.\n\nWhen he's not going full throttle on the racetrack, Hamel is working on his other business, Full Throttle Rifle Company.\n\nHamel knows his way around the drag strip... and his race car... so much so he has the trophies to prove it. In bracket racing, your opponent isn't the car next to you, it's yourself and your ability to hit your time down to a fraction of a second.\n\nAnd Hamel knows a thing or two about competing with himself, as he's worked hard for years to get himself to where he is today, rehabbing through a life-changing injury to becoming a champion driver, time after time.\n\nWhether it’s racing his car, re-designing guns, or working on trucks with his dad and brother, Justin Hamel doesn’t let being in a wheelchair slow him down.",

        "title": "Huskers set for Big Ten opener against No. 21 Michigan",
        "description": "Big Ten play has arrived for undefeated Nebraska (3-0), and head coach Matt Rhule says his team is confident and ready as the Huskers prepare to host No. 21 Michigan (2-1) on Saturday.\n\n“They’ve approached this week just like all the other weeks,” Rhule said. “We have a goal of being consistent and consistently improving. We don’t want to be the same next week as we were this week, or this week as we were last week. To me, they’ve been very good about that.”\n\nThe matchup marks Nebraska’s first game this season against a ranked opponent. For Rhule, the opportunity is about more than standings. He said it’s about building memories and showing what Nebraska football represents.\n\nThis week also carries extra meaning in Lincoln, as the school will honor the 1995 national championship team. Rhule said that tradition continues to inspire the current roster.\n\n“It’s really something special to be at a school where you’re not trying to do something for the first time, where it’s been done,” Rhule said. “Because when you know that it’s been done, you know it can be done.”\n\nNebraska will have a full roster available, Rhule confirmed. School officials are urging fans to arrive early for the 2:30 p.m. nationally televised kickoff, as heavy crowds and tailgating are expected around Memorial Stadium.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "description": "NOTE: Due to YouTube Upload copyright for shorts, Thunderstruck has been replaced.\n\nNebraska lit up Memorial Stadium on Saturday night, scoring 68 points in a rout while the Akron Zips scored ZIP points. It’s Big Red’s most points scored since dropping 73 on Idaho State in 2012. While the offensive explosion piled up 728 total yards — the eighth-highest total in school history — the story of the night belonged to the Huskers finding new playmakers.\n\nJunior tight end Luke Lindenmeyer caught a 10-yard touchdown in the second quarter, his first career score, before celebrating postgame with an engagement. \n\nNot long after, redshirt freshman receiver Quinn Clark broke free for a 37-yard touchdown reception, also the first of his young career.\n\nOn defense, true freshman Kade Pietrzak made his debut felt early. His first career tackle came in the backfield, resulting in a safety that gave Nebraska a 9-0 lead and marked the team’s first safety since last year’s opener.\n\nBackup quarterback TJ Lateef, another true freshman, provided a spark in the second half. He went 6-of-7 passing for 128 yards and capped his night with his first career rushing touchdown.\nAll of it came behind a record-setting night from quarterback Dylan Raiola, who completed 24-of-31 passes for a career-high 364 yards and four touchdowns, extending his streak to a school-record 20 straight completions.\n\nThe shutout marked Nebraska’s first since the 2009 Holiday Bowl when they beat Arizona 33-0. They look to advance to 3-0 when they host Houston Christian on Saturday, the 13th, with an 11 am kickoff.\n\n#nebraskafootball #lukelindenmeyer #gbr #gobigred #huskersfb #cornhuskers #huskers",

        "description": "The top-ranked Nebraska volleyball team returned home unbeaten after a statement weekend on the road, sweeping No. 16 Penn State and Rutgers to move to 14-0.\n\nNebraska opened the weekend with a decisive sweep of Penn State, allowing just 34 points across three sets — one of the most dominant wins in program history. The Huskers followed that performance with another sweep at Rutgers, where a record-setting crowd of 8,000 fans packed the arena — the largest volleyball attendance ever in New Jersey.\n\nHead coach Dani Busboom Kelly said the trip offered a strong test early in Big Ten play — and her team delivered.\n\n“We played great on both sides of the ball,” Busboom Kelly said. “Our defense was sharp, our offense was clicking, and we got great contributions from a lot of players.”\n\nFreshman Manaia Ogbechie said the energy on the East Coast trip caught the team by surprise.\n\n“It was so loud,” Ogbechie said. “There was so much support from everybody, and it’s amazing how much people care about our team and the sport.”\n\nThe weekend also provided valuable experience for Nebraska’s young roster learning to handle Big Ten pressure.\n\n“Every match feels like a battle,” freshman Teraya Sigler said. “People are yelling, heckling — but you just have to block it out and play your game.”\n\nNow, Nebraska turns its attention to a home match against Washington on Friday before heading to West Lafayette to face No. 12 Purdue on Sunday — a quick turnaround that Busboom Kelly called “a first.”\n\n“We’ll practice at Purdue on Saturday since we play early Sunday,” she said. “It’s not our normal routine, but we want to get comfortable in their gym.”\n\nThe Huskers will host a red-white stripe-out at the Bob Devaney Sports Center on Friday night. Fans are encouraged to check their ticket sections and wear the corresponding color to show their “Big Red” pride.\n\n#Huskers #NebraskaVolleyball #GBR #TerayaSigler #danibusboomkelly #ManaiaOgbechie",

        "description": "Nebraska’s defense is sharpening fundamentals and building depth as the Huskers prepare for their season opener next Thursday against Cincinnati at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nDefensive coordinator John Butler said the past two scrimmages have provided a valuable test. “I think the scrimmage has been great because it’s iron on iron. We’ve got two good units, a good offense, and a good defense,” Butler said. He emphasized the importance of playing aggressively without losing focus downfield, and said early mistakes have been corrected through fundamentals.\n\nFor position coaches, the goal is developing complete players. Outside linebackers and defensive linemen are learning to balance rushing the passer with stopping the run and defending against complex offensive schemes. “It’s an all-around game,” inside linebackers coach Phil Simpson said. “We stand consistent with the fundamentals, and that’s going to carry us over to the first game.”\n\nDefensive line coach Terry Bradden noted his personal ties to Kansas City and the excitement surrounding the Arrowhead opener. “It’s a beautiful stadium,” Bradden said. “It’s one day at a time, focus on the small things, but it’s going to be a great experience.”\n\nLinebackers and other players also expressed enthusiasm about playing in Kansas City. Senior linebacker Dasan McCullough said, “For my last year to be able to play my season opener in KC against Cincinnati, where I was born, it’s going to be huge. I have a lot of people coming.” Many players noted that family and friends are clamoring for tickets, underscoring the excitement and support from the Big Red Kingdom.\n\nWith only 10 days until kickoff, Nebraska’s defense says it is ready to translate practice intensity into game-day performance.",

The proposed center aimed to address space concerns by relocating the Buffalo County Sheriff's Office and Kearney Police Department to a new building with over double the current amount of space. Buffalo County Sheriff Neil Miller said with the bond being rejected, they are in a tough spot. \"We didn't really talk about a plan B or plan C. But we'll get together and kind of look at other alternatives that we can do and discuss what that might look like.\"\n\nRead more:https://nebraska.tv/news/local/buffalo-county-voters-reject-72m-law-enforcement-center-proposal#",

        "title": "Huskers Playoff Hopes go Dark with Loss to USC on Blackout Night",
        "description": "On a blackout night at Memorial Stadium, the 409th consecutive sellout in Lincoln, Nebraska’s College Football Playoff hopes went dark. The Huskers’ chances are basically 0% now after losing their third game of the year, a 21-17 loss to No. 23 USC. Nebraska is now 0-29 against AP Top 25 teams since 2016.\n\n“This is a very bitter pill for us to swallow,” head coach Matt Rhule said. “We had a lot of opportunities to win the football game. I don’t think anyone’s held them to 21 points very often. They’re explosive and we had some really good, valiant moments, but we lost the game, so we’ll have to get better.”\n\nThe Huskers led 14-6 at halftime, but their offense went quiet after quarterback Dylan Raiola left with a right ankle injury early in the second half. He didn’t return, and Nebraska scored just three points the rest of the way.\n\n“I don’t think you can put a guy out there who can’t defend and protect himself,” Rhule said. “The trainers didn’t want him to go out there, but they didn’t say no he can’t. They just kind of said he shouldn’t be out there, so I told Dylan I love you too much to ask you to play when you’re hurt like this.”\n\nRunning back Emmett Johnson did his part, carrying 29 times for 165 yards and a touchdown. It was his fifth 100-yard game of the season, putting him over 1,000 yards on the year.\n\n“I’m thankful to God for the opportunity to do that and give credit to my line,” Johnson said. “But that doesn’t mean anything if we don’t win the game. That’s all that matters to me.”\n\nDefensively, Nebraska held USC nearly 200 yards under its season average, giving up just 337 total yards and only 135 through the air — the Trojans’ lowest passing total in nearly seven years. Still, big plays proved costly.\n\n“I don’t want to sound like we’re victims of circumstance,” defensive back Ceyair Wright said. “At the end of the day, don’t hang your head. We had a good fight.”\n\nOn a night that was supposed to be a statement for Nebraska football, the Huskers instead fell short. Rhule, who signed a contract extension earlier in the week, is now 0-7 against ranked opponents at Nebraska.\n\nNext up, Nebraska travels to Pasadena to face UCLA. The 3-5 Bruins are coming off a bye week, just like USC was this week.\n\n#GBR #Huskers #MattRhule #NebraskaFootball #HuskerSports\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #nebraskafootball",

        "title": "Huskers Score 24 Unanswered Points in 2nd Half to Beat Michigan State.",
        "description": "“Take their soul.”\n\nThose were the words of Nebraska wide receiver Jacory Barney Jr. to his teammates at halftime Saturday, when the Huskers led Michigan State 14-7. In recent years, Nebraska teams have let opponents hang around in close games. This group refused to let that happen.\n\nAfter falling behind 21-14 in the third quarter, Dylan Raiola and the Huskers responded with 24 unanswered points to pull away for a 38-27 win at Memorial Stadium. The victory improved Nebraska to 4-1 overall and 1-1 in Big Ten play.\n\n“It felt good to come out here and get that taste out of our mouths,” Barney said. “We’ve been waiting for a while to play again, and now we’re on to next week.”\n\nHead coach Matt Rhule called it a complete team win. Jamir Conn blocked a punt that Carter Nelson returned for a touchdown, while Nebraska finished with a plus-three turnover margin on the day.\n\n“These are the types of plays that make this season feel different,” Raiola said. “We weren’t going to let it slip away. You train all offseason for that moment, and when it’s there, you have to take it.”\n\nRunning back Emmett Johnson continued to lead the offense, posting more than 100 yards from scrimmage and scoring three rushing touchdowns.\n\nOn defense, DeShon Singleton recorded two first-half interceptions, while Elijah Jeudy notched his first career sack.\n\n“Go out and ball, Singleton said. It’s hunt or be hunted, and we’re hunting.”\n\nVeteran linebacker Javin Wright, in his seventh year with the program, said the belief within this team feels different from years past.\n\n“No knock on the other teams I’ve been with,” Wright said. “But the culture inside this locker room and on the sidelines — there’s just a belief that we’re going to win, whether we’re up or down. There’s never a doubt.”\n\nNebraska will carry that confidence into its first true road game of the season next week at Maryland (4-1), which suffered its first loss of the year to Washington on Saturday.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "description": "Press Release Courtesy of Nebraska Athletics-\n\nNo. 25 Nebraska was held to a season-low 213 yards, while Minnesota’s Darius Taylor rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown in Minnesota’s 24-6 victory over Nebraska Friday night.\n\nThe Huskers (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten) got only a pair of Kyle Cunanan field goals, as their two-game win streak was snapped. Dylan Raiola completed 16-of-24 passes for 172 yards but was sacked nine times and NU managed just 36 yards rushing.\n\nMinnesota (4-2, 3-1 Big Ten) was efficient offensively, as the Gophers rushed for 186 yards while Drake Lindsey completed 16-of-20 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown and rushed for another score.\n\nNebraska struck first, as the Huskers marched 70 yards on 12 plays to set up Cunanan’s 33-yard field goal on the final play of the first quarter. Raiola found Luke Lindenmeyer on a 26-yard completion to get the Huskers to near midfield. NU continued to march, as a Gopher pass interference call and a 10-yard catch from Nyziah Hunter got the Huskers to the red zone. A four-yard run by Emmett Johnson on first down put the Huskers at the 10-yard line, but the drive stalled, forcing a field goal.\n\nJohnson totaled nearly 100 all-purpose yards, as he rushed for 63 yards on 14 carries while catching five passes for 37 yards.\n\nMinnesota came right back, needing just four plays to go 90 yards to take a 7-3 lead. The Gophers had 90 of their 154 first-half yards on the drive, highlighted by a 71-yard run by Taylor to the Husker 1-yard line before Lindsey’s sneak capped the scoring drive.\n\nNebraska trimmed the Gopher lead to 7-6 midway through the second quarter after Cunanan’s second field goal of the day, this one from 30 yards. A career-long 43-yard reception from Quinn Clark and an 11-yard rush from Johnson gave the Huskers first and 10 at the Minnesota 11, but the Gopher defense stiffened, and NU had to settle for a field goal.\n\nMinnesota extended its lead to 14-6 following a 14-play, 98-yard march that took nearly nine minutes off the clock. The Huskers had a chance to get the Gophers off the field, as Minnesota went for it on fourth-and-three from the NU 34. Lindsey’s pass was incomplete, but a defensive holding call kept the drive alive. Two plays later, Lindsey found Lemeke Brockington for the 20-yard touchdown pass.\n\nThe Gophers stretched the lead to 21-6 after a Taylor 1-yard run capped a six-play, 62-yard drive. A costly Husker defensive penalty kept Minnesota’s drive alive before Lindsey found Jalen Smith on a 35-yard catch and run to set up the score. Minnesota extended the margin to 24-6 on a 30-yard field goal from Brady Denaburg with 5:14 left for the final score.\n\nThe Huskers will return to action next Saturday, as Nebraska host Northwestern at Memorial Stadium. The kickoff time and network will be determined following Saturday’s games.\n\n\n#GBR #Huskers #MattRhule #NebraskaFootball #HuskerSports\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Huskers Shut Out Akron 68-0!",
        "description": "Nebraska lit up Memorial Stadium on Saturday night, scoring 68 points in a rout while the Akron Zips scored ZIP points. It’s Big Red’s most points scored since dropping 73 on Idaho State in 2012. While the offensive explosion piled up 728 total yards — the eighth-highest total in school history — the story of the night belonged to the Huskers finding new playmakers.\n\nJunior tight end Luke Lindenmeyer caught a 10-yard touchdown in the second quarter, his first career score, before celebrating postgame with an engagement. \n\nNot long after, redshirt freshman receiver Quinn Clark broke free for a 37-yard touchdown reception, also the first of his young career.\n\nOn defense, true freshman Kade Pietrzak made his debut felt early. His first career tackle came in the backfield, resulting in a safety that gave Nebraska a 9-0 lead and marked the team’s first safety since last year’s opener.\n\nBackup quarterback TJ Lateef, another true freshman, provided a spark in the second half. He went 6-of-7 passing for 128 yards and capped his night with his first career rushing touchdown.\nAll of it came behind a record-setting night from quarterback Dylan Raiola, who completed 24-of-31 passes for a career-high 364 yards and four touchdowns, extending his streak to a school-record 20 straight completions.\n\nThe shutout marked Nebraska’s first since the 2009 Holiday Bowl when they beat Arizona 33-0. They look to advance to 3-0 when they host Houston Christian on Saturday, the 13th, with an 11 am kickoff.\n\n#nebraskafootball #lukelindenmeyer #gbr #gobigred #huskersfb #cornhuskers #huskers",

        "description": "LINCOLN, Neb. — Nebraska looks to improve to 3-0 for the third straight season when it hosts Houston Christian on Saturday. It will mark the first-ever meeting between the Huskers and the Huskies.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola is coming off a historic performance. Raiola completed 20 consecutive passes spanning the Cincinnati and Akron games, breaking a school record that had stood for 51 years. The previous mark was 15.\n\n“He’s incredible,” offensive lineman Rocco Spindler said. “That’s a guy that knows ball and he trusts us too. If we see something, he’s willing to change the protection and trust our eyes. He can make crazy throws. Dylan’s a great quarterback, leader, friend—everything. We’re extremely thankful for him.”\n\nHouston Christian enters the matchup averaging nearly 400 yards per game, with 173 of those through the air. Nebraska defensive coordinator John Butler said his unit will be prepared.\n\n“No matter who it is—whether it’s Cincinnati, Akron, Houston Christian, Michigan or Michigan State—we have a healthy respect for them,” Butler said. “A lot of what we do on the practice field is making sure we’re executing our defense. Fundamentally, physically, effort-wise, and execution-wise, we’re on point. I thought today was a pretty good practice, so I think we have their attention.”\n\nThe Huskers are in the middle of a four-game homestand. Saturday’s kickoff at Memorial Stadium is set for just after 11 a.m.\n\n#nebraskafootball #cornhuskers #gobigred #huskerfootball #dylanraiola",

The senior, a first-team all-state selection in 2024, has thrown for 531 yards, 11 touchdowns and just one interception through the first three games of the 2025 season.\n\nZickman opened the year with a four-touchdown performance in a 38-7 win over Ord.\n\n“Last season didn’t end the way we hoped, losing the state championship game,” Zickman said. “We’ve been grinding ever since last spring, putting in early morning work all summer and fall camp. We’re just ready to go.”\n\nHis head coach said the biggest growth hasn’t just been on the field.\n\n“His leadership has really grown in his second year starting,” Troy Huebert said. “He’s a lot more comfortable, and seeing him take that step has been fun to watch.”\n\nWith Zickman under center, the Bison believe they’re never out of the fight.\n\n#nebpreps #nebraskafootball",

        "description": "Nebraska men’s basketball closed out its preseason schedule with a dominant 91-50 win over Midland on Monday night inside Pinnacle Bank Arena.\n\nComing off a scrimmage win over a top-10 BYU team last week, head coach Fred Hoiberg said he didn’t want a letdown against the in-state NAIA opponent. Early turnovers tested the Huskers’ focus, but they quickly found their rhythm.\n\nBrandon Frager provided the spark on both ends, hitting six 3-pointers and making a highlight-reel block in transition that he called his favorite play of the game. Nebraska went 15-for-44 from behind the arc (34%) and shot 44% overall from the field.\n\nAfter a close start, the Huskers built a 20-point lead by halftime and never looked back.\n\n“We didn’t want to overextend Rink in this game,” Hoiberg said. “It was good to get Ugnius out there for a stretch and got everybody on the floor. It was a good preseason for us, and now the fun begins.”\n\nHoiberg praised his team’s physicality and defensive adjustments, noting the group’s improvement in communication during media timeouts.\n\nNebraska will open the regular season at Pinnacle Bank Arena on Monday, Nov. 3, against West Georgia.\n\n#cornhuskers #huskers #gobigred #nebraska #nebraskabasketball #fredhoiberg #nebraskabasketball #cornhuskersbasketball",

        "description": "On a cold, gray October afternoon at Riverside Golf Club, the competition was anything but dull as the NSAA awarded its first state championship of the new school year. The Class A Girls State Golf Championship came down to the final holes — and a Columbus senior came out on top.\n\nMolly Goc of Columbus captured the individual state title with a two-day total of 149, edging Lincoln Southwest freshman Naryn Kim by one stroke. Kim finished second with a 150, while her teammate, senior Eden Larson, placed third at 151.\n\n“It means a lot,” Goc said after the win. “All the hard work that I put in has finally paid off and it feels amazing. I plan to go to Wayne to play golf.”\n\nIn the team competition, Omaha Marian successfully defended its state championship, posting a total score of 636 to claim back-to-back titles. Omaha Westside finished runner-up for the second year in a row with a score of 669.\n\n“They’ve got a state championship trophy — their second in two years — and we’re really proud of their effort this year,” Marian’s coach Robert Davis said. “They had a great season. The girls had a goal to go back, win state again, and finish in the top 10 at nationals.”\n\nMarian placed 13th at the national high school tournament last year and will return with hopes of cracking the top 10 this time around.\n\nLocally, Kearney placed fifth with a team score of 700. North Platte junior Allie Jones tied for fifth individually, joining a handful of area golfers who finished inside the top 25.\n\nIndividual results: https://www.golfgenius.com/pages/5643252\n\nTeam results: https://www.golfgenius.com/pages/5643252\n\n#golf #golfing #nebraska #athlete #highschoolsports #sports #sportsnews #news #NSAA #nebraskagolf",

The team, led by Dr. Xin Qiao, an irrigation management specialist, has been developing the project for over two years and recently showcased it to the public at Husker Harvest Days.\n\nDr. Qiao explained that the inspiration for the device came from observing other self-powered valve products. \"So the idea came from...a valve product [that] can generate power kind of by itself, with actuators. So we were thinking this can be used for irrigation equipment\" he said.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/unl-researchers-unveil-innovative-irrigation-device-prototype#",

She said Utah came out strong in the first set, serving well and putting Nebraska on its heels, but strategic changes in rotations and a few key substitutions gave Rebekah different looks and helped the Huskers gain control. DBK praised the team’s defense, highlighting strong blocking from Bergren and Virginia, and noted improvements from Allie and the backcourt duo of Liv and Laney. He pointed out a strategic libero change and standout serving from Andi in the second set, saying those efforts helped shift momentum. DBK acknowledged that the team is working on starting faster and making mental adjustments, but emphasized that nothing will change for tomorrow’s match. She also celebrated the return of alumni, recalling how past teams inspired her own passion for volleyball, and stressed the importance of focusing on one thing at a time to stay sharp.\n\n#HuskerVB #GBR #NebraskaVolleyball #DaniBussboomKelly #HuskerSports",

        "title": "Drone technology takes center stage at Husker Harvest Days",
        "description": "Husker Harvest Days launched on Tuesday, featuring a bustling array of vendors, food and for the first time, a designated 'Drone zone'. Austin Leuth from Red Solutions, who helped give demonstrations at the Drone Zone, noted the growing interest in drone technology among attendees.\n\n\"Drones have been around. However I think the adoption or the acceptability of drones is increasing. There might be a day in our near future that you'll see a drone in every farm right now,\" said Leuth. He showcased the HD580 drone, designed for spraying but capable of using attachments like a spreader.\n\nLeuth emphasized the importance of embracing technology, stating, \"I think it takes the right person not to be scared of technology, be innovative. But you don't want to wait. The longer you wait, you're going to be behind. I think the technology is there. The changes today aren't going to be those peaks and valleys, it's going to be more of a plateau.\"\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/drone-technology-takes-center-stage-at-husker-harvest-days#",

        "description": "Nebraska didn’t just win on Saturday, the Huskers sent a message about the standard they expect to uphold.\n\nThe Huskers rolled Houston Christian 59-7 at Memorial Stadium, improving to 3-0 for the second straight year. It marked Nebraska’s ninth straight non-conference victory, each time holding opponents under 20 points.\n\n“We haven’t played the caliber teams we’re going to play,” head coach Matt Rhule said. “But all you can do is measure yourself against where you are and the standards that you have. To be 3-0 and dominate the two teams we’re supposed to dominate, that’s all I can ask of the guys.”\n\nThe defense again set the tone. Nebraska has now held three straight opponents under 100 yards passing for the first time since 1990. Offensively, the Huskers have scored 50 or more points in consecutive games for the first time since 2007, and posted 500-plus yards of offense in back-to-back weeks for the first time since 2021.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola kept the offense sharp, throwing for 222 yards and two touchdowns in one half of action. With the performance, Raiola moved into the top 10 on Nebraska’s career passing list.\n\n“Overall understanding of the game, just the leadership part of it, trusting my guys to make plays, ready for the challenge,” Raiola said. “It’ll be full force coming in here on Saturday next week.”\n\nWide receiver Dane Key, a transfer from Kentucky, continued to make an immediate impact. He caught four passes for 104 yards and a touchdown, his third score in as many games. With the performance, he surpassed 2,000 career receiving yards, becoming just the eighth active FBS player to reach that mark.\n\n“I’m super excited that was accomplished today,” Key said. “But that’s in the past now, so I just have to keep going.”\n\nThe Huskers will now turn their focus to Big Ten play, where the challenge escalates quickly. No. 23 Michigan visits Memorial Stadium next Saturday, Nebraska’s first ranked opponent of the season.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #danekey #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball #mattrhule",

        "description": "Trains are once again a topic of discussion in Grand Island as State Senator Margo Juarez leads a renewed push for expanding passenger rail across Nebraska. Juarez is touring the state, hosting town halls to advocate for legislation promoting passenger rail.\n\n\"We're so car centric in this state, and I think that it would be better to have some options,\" said Juarez. She is working on Legislative Resolution 203, which proposes an interim study on rail infrastructure in the state. Juarez emphasized the need for a proper rail planning study, noting that one has not been conducted in nearly 20 years. She said she envisions a future with safer, cheaper, and more convenient transportation options, including daytime Amtrak service, additional stops and special service cars for events like football and volleyball games.\n\n\"I even have this dream of possibly attracting even more future talent to serve in the legislature like myself,\" said Juarez. \"If people realize that they can have easier transportation to Lincoln instead of driving all the time.\"\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/renewed-push-for-passenger-rail-expansion-in-nebraska#",

        "title": "Huskers Refocuses After Loss to Minnesota for a Tough Northwestern Big Ten Match Up",
        "description": "Nebraska returned to the practice field this week intent on correcting the mistakes that led to its loss at Minnesota, with coaches and players echoing a unified message: accountability and improvement must come immediately if the Huskers want to become bowl eligible.\n\nHead coach Matt Rhule’s message, coordinators and players said, was clear and received. The responsibility for the performance — and the response — is on them.\n\n“We’ve just got to do better. We’ve got to practice better, we’ve got to prepare better, and we’ve got to go play better,” offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen said Tuesday. “It starts with me. I’m responsible for what the offensive production is.”\n\nHolgorsen stressed the need to establish the run and distribute the football more effectively after the offense struggled to push the ball downfield against Minnesota.\n\n“I’ve got to get them in better plays that are quicker,” Holgorsen said. “Felt like we could push the ball down the field a little bit more against these guys, and it reared its ugly head again.”\n\nOn the defensive side, coordinator John Butler said takeaways and physicality must return to the forefront of the unit’s identity.\n\n“I have to do a better job of designing things and calling things that are going to do that,” Butler said. “The takeaways will come as we get that accomplished.”\n\nButler acknowledged that Minnesota’s 70-yard touchdown run early in the game altered his approach more than it should have.\n\n“That probably affected me more than it should, and it shouldn’t,” he said. “Every play has its own life. I’ve got to stick to the plan and say regardless of what happened on the previous play, we’ve still got to approach the game with an aggressive mentality.”\n\nPlayers said they felt the same urgency from the coaching staff — and from each other.\n\n“Just as a team, just playing hard and not just taking punches and not swinging back,” quarterback Dylan Raiola said. “That just goes back to having pride for our university and for this football team.”\n\nNebraska (and its 15th-ranked rushing defense in the conference) will be tested immediately against Northwestern, which enters the week ranked sixth in the Big Ten in rushing offense. Players said they expect a fight up front and know the game plan is simple.\n\n“We’ve just got to fight. We’ve just got to do our job,” tight end Luke Lindenmeyer said. “It sucks that we had to have a loss to have motivation to get back to that, but that’s what it took. This week we’re getting back to who we are.”\n\nInjury Update\n\nRight guard Rocco Spindler, who has started every game this season, returned to practice Tuesday after suffering a gruesome broken finger against Minnesota that required weekend surgery. He practiced with a cast, and teammates said his effort set the tone.\n\n“If he can get up and practice and be on pace to play against Northwestern, there’s no reason that we can’t match that energy,” tight end Luke Lindemeyer said.\n\nNebraska hosts Northwestern on Saturday with kickoff at 11 AM CST as it continues its push for bowl eligibility.\n\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "description": "Nebraska football returned to the AP Top 25 this week, checking in at No. 25, just one spot ahead of No. 24 Cincinnati, a team the Huskers defeated in their season opener.\n\nAs Nebraska prepares to face Minnesota Friday night, head coach Matt Rhule said he’s proud of the growth his team has shown since Week 1 and is focused on building momentum toward a 6-1 record.\n\n“For us, if we go out there and we’re minus three, then we are who we were two or three years ago,” Rhule said. “We shouldn’t be that. We’re better, so we should just not give the game away and try to win the close games.”\n\nRhule also addressed rumors linking him to Penn State, emphasizing his commitment to Nebraska. “But this is what happens when you win. I’ve dealt with it at Temple and Baylor. I’m not going to talk about my contract here. I’m going to talk about the team. Players all across the country want to come here. We have the best facilities. We have elite fans. I’m really happy here and excited to get going this week on Minnesota.”\n\nNebraska enters the matchup 5-1 overall and 2-1 in Big Ten play. Minnesota is 4-2 overall, also 2-1 in conference play. A win would mark Nebraska’s first back-to-back road victories since 2006. The Huskers will face a Gophers team that has beaten Nebraska in five straight meetings and ranks among the nation’s best in turnover margin — a key focus after Nebraska finished minus-three against Maryland.\n\nDefensively, Nebraska remains one of the nation’s best, ranking first in passing defense and 14th overall, while quarterback Dylan Raiola leads an offense averaging more than 40 points per game, 11th nationally. Rhule stressed the need for the team to play complimentary football and close out games after allowing late comebacks in recent weeks.\n\nThe Huskers will wear all white Friday night in Minnesota as part of a joint breast cancer awareness initiative with the Gophers. On the injury front, defensive back Malcolm Hartzog remains questionable after missing the last couple of games with a lower-body injury.\n\nNebraska’s rise into the AP Top 25 marks consecutive years in the poll for the first time since 2016.\n\n#GBR #Huskers #MattRhule #NebraskaFootball #HuskerSports\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Nebraska Volleyball Faces Tough Road Test at No. 11 Wisconsin Friday and Home to Oregon Sunday",
        "description": "Nebraska volleyball continues to roll through the 2025 season, entering the weekend 20-0 overall and 10-0 in Big Ten play. The nation’s No. 1 team has already collected seven wins over ranked opponents, including victories against Pittsburgh, Stanford, Penn State, and Creighton.\n\nThe toughest challenge yet may await Friday night when Nebraska travels to Madison to face No. 11 Wisconsin — a rivalry matchup with plenty of history. Since the teams first met in 2011, Wisconsin holds a slim 13-12 edge over the Huskers. The Badgers also defeated Nebraska in the 2021 NCAA Championship match to capture their first national title.\n\nNebraska has had the upper hand more recently, sweeping Wisconsin twice in the 2024 regular season, followed by a regional final victory in Lincoln to advance to the NCAA semifinals.\n\nHead coach Dani Busboom Kelly said the Badgers’ talent makes them a complete test. “They have one of the best lefts in the country and one of the best middles,” she said. “They’re definitely going to be motivated to beat us. The whole matchup is challenging.”\n\nSenior Rebekah Allick said the team embraces the moment. “We live for high-level volleyball,” she said. “Being ranked No. 1 is cool, but it doesn’t determine who wins Saturday night.”\n\nSetter Bergen Reilly added that Nebraska’s competitiveness in practice keeps the group sharp heading into late October.\n\nAfter Friday’s road trip, Nebraska returns home to host Oregon on Sunday afternoon. Busboom Kelly expects that quick turnaround to be another test. “That’s going to be a huge challenge coming off a night game on the road and facing a confident Oregon team,” she said.\n\nNebraska continues to dominate not just on the court, but in attendance. The Huskers lead the nation in home attendance and rank second when factoring in crowds for their road matches — meaning Nebraska volleyball owns both the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in national attendance.\n\nBusboom Kelly said she appreciates how Big Red fans travel, but expects a true road test in Madison. “Wisconsin fans love their volleyball too,” she said. “It’ll be a wild environment.”\n\n#HuskerVB #GBR #NebraskaVolleyball #bergenreilly #rebekahallick #HuskerSports",

        "description": "Lincoln, NEB — Press Release from Nebraska Athletics-\n\nNebraska volleyball's Bergen Reilly and Rebekah Allick earned Big Ten weekly conference awards on Monday.

        "description": "\"The city officials are working to clear some of the trees up by the courthouse and around town. There's a lot of a lot of trees being cut right now. You can hear chainsaws in the background, actually,\" Beck said.\n\nA worker with the Loup City Utility Department said that while they weren't sure the total extent of the damages, he observed mostly fallen limbs, with only a few instances of damage to houses or vehicles. However, Cindy Ryan, a Loup City resident, experienced damage firsthand. She recounted asking her husband Mark to secure their patio furniture around the time when the wind was at its worst.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/loup-city-residents-face-extensive-tree-damage-after-wind-storm#",

        "description": "Nebraska football held its final preseason scrimmage Saturday behind closed doors, while the Husker volleyball team hosted its annual alumni match. Both programs are set to provide updates later Saturday evening.\n\nBefore the scrimmage, sophomore quarterback Dylan Raiola spoke with the media Friday in a wide-ranging session. Among the topics was punter Archie Wilson, whose emotional press conference earlier this month went viral and drew national attention.\n\nRaiola said the team was deeply moved by Wilson’s story.\n\n“They showed the clip in the team meeting, and I got chicken skin seeing that,” Raiola said. “I remember when Archie came on his visit with his parents from Australia. They were explaining the travel it took to get here, and I couldn’t really believe it. I think he deserves all the praise he’s getting.”\n\nWilson, who came to Lincoln from Melbourne, has had to adjust to more than football. From learning American terminology to punting in yards instead of meters, Raiola said the transition hasn’t been easy.\n\n“He’s kind of just been plopped down in the middle of the United States and had to grow up quick,” Raiola said. “We’ve seen nothing but that from him. The guys have surrounded him with love and open arms.”\n\nWilson’s unique skillset has also impressed his teammates. Known for his ability to punt with both legs, Raiola said Wilson can roll right or left before striking the ball — a versatility that could become a weapon this season.\n\n“It’ll be pretty cool to see — hopefully not too much — but to see him punt in games,” Raiola added.\n\nWilson’s story has resonated beyond the locker room. Fans across Nebraska, particularly on social media, embraced him as part of the community.\n\n“He has a family here,” Raiola said. “And when you feel good, you play good.”",

With views overlooking Fonner Park, visitors can watch the fairgrounds transform each morning, from quiet early hours to a bustling hub of activity.\n\nTo read more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/nebraska-state-fair-prepares-for-156th-commencement-with-gi-casino-resort-open#",

        "title": "ICE Detention facility 'Cornhusker Clink' confirmed",
        "description": "Governor Pillen announced that the Department of Homeland Security is creating an ICE detention facility akin to 'Alligator Alcatraz' in McCook. The facility would replace the existing Work Ethic Camp detention facility and would increase its capacity from 200 beds to around 300. Pillen called the move a triumph for border security in the U.S.\n\n\"We're simply doing our part to get these people the heck out of get them off of our streets, get them out of our communities and get them the heck out of here,\" said Pillen.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said earlier this month that Nebraska was on her short list of places for additional ICE facilities, and said that they were looking for a place with proximity to an airport. On Noem's X account she already embraced the nickname of 'Cornhusker Clink' and shared a post about it. Pillen says that he doesn't know if men, women, or children would be detained in the facility, but said there wouldn't be any safety concerns.\n\n\"The security keeping us safe is the highest priority. I've told the mayor, 'If there's any hole, you call me, we will get it fixed,'\" said Pillen.\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/pillen-confirms-ice-detention-facility-coming-to-mccook-sparking-protest-and-praise#",

        "description": "Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola could not hide his excitement Friday as the Huskers unveiled new black alternate uniforms for their Nov. 1 matchup against USC at Memorial Stadium.\n\n“We love them. The whole team loves them. We all love them,” Raiola said. “Hope our fans come out to the USC game and rock their black. I think it’s something special.”\n\nBeyond the uniforms, Raiola said his biggest growth entering year two as starting quarterback has been his command of the offense.\n\n“Understanding why we’re running a play, what we’re running it against, and what can beat it—I feel comfortable right now,” Raiola said.\n\nOffensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen praised Raiola’s progress, pointing to his leadership and poise.\n\n“His leadership is outstanding. The play is fantastic,” Holgorsen said. “He’s making throws I’ve never seen before. He’s in a good spot and he’s ready for game day.”\n\nHolgorsen added that the offense has shown more explosive moments this preseason than in previous years but emphasized the need for sustained drives. He said Saturday’s scrimmage will provide a better test in simulating game conditions.\n\n“We do a nice job in drills and kind of three-and-out stuff, but we haven’t done a live scrimmage where it’s, ‘Hey, eight minutes on the clock, can we go get a touchdown in the fourth quarter?’” Holgorsen said.\n\nOffensive line coach Donovan Raiola, Dylan’s uncle, also pointed to the quarterback’s growing communication with the line in his second year.\n\n“The comfort level they have on and off the field has really grown,” Raiola said.\n\nHead coach Matt Rhule is expected to provide a full update after Saturday’s scrimmage, the final one before the Huskers begin game-week preparation.",

        "description": "Nebraska volleyball closed out a perfect weekend at the Bob Devaney Sports Center, sweeping Rice State on Friday and California on Sunday to improve to 6-0 under first-year head coach Danielle Buss.\n\nThe Huskers did not drop a set in either match, extending Buss’s undefeated start in Lincoln. Still, the coach said the team’s performance wasn’t flawless.\n\n“Not everybody gets to win. We always say it’s hard to win, and to win in that fashion against anybody is pretty impressive,” Buss said. “But on Friday, we didn’t play our best. After watching the tape, we actually played worse than we thought. I was excited to see a sharper focus against Cal.”\n\nThat focus was highlighted by freshman setter Campbell Flynn, who made her debut Sunday. Buss praised Flynn for running an efficient offense in her first action.\n\n“She came in cold, didn’t play Friday night, and I thought she was awesome,” Buss said. “She ran a great offense, and she’s super confident out there.”\n\nFlynn said playing in front of the Devaney Center crowd was a moment she won’t forget.\n\n“The crowd was awesome, my team was awesome, and I had a really fun time,” Flynn said.\n\nAll-American middle blocker [player’s name if available] credited Flynn for setting the tone in the middle.\n\n“When Campbell came in, she was just firing the ball and did an awesome job getting it to the middle,” she said. “It was really easy to get hot from there.”\n\nNebraska now turns its attention to the Husker Invitational. The Huskers host Utah on Friday and Grand Canyon on Saturday before traveling to Omaha on Tuesday for a highly anticipated matchup with Creighton.\n#HuskerVB #GBR #NebraskaVolleyball #DaniBussboomKelly #HuskerSports",

After trailing 10–0, Nebraska rallied to tie the game at 17–17 by halftime, highlighted by a 52-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass from Raiola to Barney Jr. However, Michigan's second-half scoring, including a 56-yard field goal and a 54-yard touchdown run, proved decisive. \n\nMichigan's victory extended its winning streak against Nebraska to five games and improved its all-time series lead to 9–4–1. The Wolverines also secured their sixth consecutive win in a Big Ten opener. \nUniversity of Michigan Athletics\n\nNebraska will look to rebound in its next conference matchup, aiming to build on the resilience shown in a hard-fought game against a ranked opponent.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "description": "Nebraska wasted little time in dispatching another Big Ten opponent. The No. 1 Huskers improved to 12-0 and 2-0 in Big Ten conference play Saturday night with a sweep of Maryland, their third consecutive straight-set victory.\n\nNebraska’s middle blockers stole the spotlight. Senior captain Rebekah Allick delivered 13 kills on 17 swings and added six blocks, while fellow captain Andi Jackson posted nine kills on 10 attempts along with five blocks.\n\n“As a middle, you dream about games like this,” Allick said. “It just makes Monday through Friday worth it.”\n\nThe Huskers identified Maryland’s blocking weaknesses in the middle and repeatedly took advantage of one-on-one matchups. “We really wanted to take advantage of that one-on-one, and it was pretty guaranteed to be there,” Jackson said.\n\nAllick’s performance also came with milestones. She moved into the program’s top five for total blocks in the rally-scoring era and finished with a career-high .800 hitting percentage.\n\n“The thing about Nebraska volleyball is it’s full of giants,” Allick said. “You don’t really do it for the accolades. You do it because you love the sport.”\n\nHead coach Dani Busboom Kelly praised her middles for carrying out the game plan. “They both had huge nights,” she said. “Executing the game plan, the middles took advantage, and that was huge.”\n\nThe Huskers have not dropped a set since a three-match stretch ago against Creighton. They remain undefeated under Busboom Kelly and now turn to their first road test outside Nebraska since August.\n\nNebraska will visit No. 15 Penn State on Oct. 3, with first serve set for 7 p.m.\n\n🔴⚪ Subscribe for more Husker coverage and highlights!\n\n#NebraskaVolleyball #Huskers #GBR #Volleyball #gobigred #huskersvolleyball #devaneycenter #danibussboomkelly  #bergenreilly  #harpermurray",

        "description": "Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule said he was encouraged by his team’s effort in Saturday’s 30-27 loss to Michigan, stressing that his players must stay disciplined during their bye week.\n\n“It’s a very calculated response — not to overreact, not to underreact, but just to be very disciplined in the way that we see things,” Rhule said Monday. “What I’ve asked our guys not to do is settle for the narrative of how we’re just a couple plays away. That’s a deadly, deadly thing when you start saying things like that.”\n\nThe Wolverines rushed for 286 yards, with three long runs accounting for more than half of that total. Rhule said those breakdowns were “very self-inflicted wounds.”\n\n“Everybody can play better,” he said. “I think it’s really important that we take ownership, but stay very neutral.”\n\nOffensively, Nebraska allowed seven sacks of quarterback Dylan Raiola. Rhule said protection issues stemmed from lack of width in the pocket, but he praised Raiola’s overall play.\n\n“I think Dylan’s playing quarterback at a really high level right now,” Rhule said.\n\nDespite the loss, Rhule pointed to improvements in special teams and passing defense and said confidence in the program remains high.\n\nRhule also reported no major injuries out of the Michigan game, calling it “just bumps and bruises.” With the bye week ahead, the Huskers conducted a film study on Sunday, will practice Tuesday through Thursday, and then allow the coaching staff to hit the recruiting trail before returning to prepare for Michigan State.\n\nIt was announced on Monday that the Michigan State game will be a 3 PM CST kickoff at Memorial Stadium on Oct 4th.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Veterans and Young Huskers Shine vs. Akron",
        "description": "Nebraska opened its home schedule with a record-setting performance Saturday night, routing Akron 68-0 at Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe 68 points were the Huskers’ most in a game since scoring 73 against Idaho State in 2012. Nebraska piled up 728 yards of total offense, the eighth-highest mark in program history.\n\nJunior tight end Luke Lindenmeyer highlighted the night with his first career touchdown — and a marriage proposal at midfield after the game. “I didn’t really tell the whole team,” Lindenmeyer said. “Coach mentioned it yesterday, and then the whole team knew and was just standing there. It was awesome.”\n\nHe wasn’t the only first-time scorer. Redshirt freshman receiver Quinn Clark caught a 37-yard touchdown, and true freshman quarterback T.J. Lateef threw for 128 yards and rushed for his first career score in relief of Dylan Raiola. Raiola, the sophomore starter, threw for 364 yards and four touchdowns, completing a school-record 20 consecutive passes spanning two games.\n\nOn defense, freshman lineman Kade Pietrzak’s first career tackle resulted in a safety — Nebraska’s first since last year’s opener.\n\nRunning back Emmett Johnson led the ground game with another 100+ yards rushing and three touchdowns (2 on the ground, 1 in the air). Transfer wide receiver Dane Key added his second touchdown in as many games.\n\nThe shutout was Nebraska’s first since the 2009 Holiday Bowl against Arizona. \n\nThe Huskers improved to 2-0 and will host Houston Christian on Sept. 13.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #danekey #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",

        "title": "Unbeaten Huskers Volleyball Stay Grounded as Big Ten Grind Continues",
        "description": "Nebraska is deep into the dog days of the season, and middle blocker Andi Jackson says the grind is real. But despite the schedule, the Huskers remain perfect. Nebraska sits at 22-0 overall and 12-0 in Big Ten play, the lone unbeaten team left in Division I volleyball and a unanimous No. 1 in this week’s national polls.\n\nHead coach Dani Busboom Kelly said she isn’t letting her team get comfortable.\n\n“We’ve been focused on getting better here and there, competing with each other,” Busboom Kelly said. “Our players understand how thin the line is this year. There are players all over the country who can take over matches and get hot, and you can find yourself in a tough situation really quick in our sport.”\n\nNebraska survived close opening sets at a ranked Wisconsin and at home against Oregon before pulling away. Jackson said the team knew their first-set defense wasn’t up to standard but responded the right way.\n\n“Everyone knows our first-set defense wasn’t our best ever,” Jackson said. “Adjusting in the second and third sets, and then at Wisconsin, we handled things there. It felt so smooth. Our team felt so connected on the court.”\n\nFreshman outside hitter Virginia Adriano continues to adjust to Big Ten volleyball, saying the pace and intensity are unlike anything she experienced in Italy.\n\n“When I first got here, I didn’t really know a lot about other teams or the rivalries,” Adriano said. “Once I understood Texas, Wisconsin, Penn State — great atmospheres, loud gyms — it’s always cool to play in places like that.”\n\nNebraska’s next two matches come against Illinois on Nov. 6 at the Devaney Center, followed by a road test at No. 22 Minnesota on Nov. 8. Busboom Kelly said Illinois features a setter she competed against during her time at Louisville, and Minnesota remains dangerous despite early injuries.\n\n“Illinois has a setter I played against for two years at Florida State — she’s a baller,” Busboom Kelly said. “Minnesota had the injury bug early on, but they’re finding ways to win and stay in the top 25. They have one of the best outsides in the country and a really good young setter. It’s always hard to play at the Pav.”\n\nNebraska also brought home individual honors this week. Middle blocker Rebekah Allick was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week (third this season, twelfth in career), and setter Bergen Reilly earned Co-Setter of the Week (second this season, fourth in career). Busboom Kelly credited their commitment to the game plan.\n\n“They’re not doing anything special,” Busboom Kelly said. “They’re just playing inside the game plan and doing what’s needed for this team to stay undefeated.”\n\n#HuskerVB #GBR #NebraskaVolleyball #bergenreilly #rebekahallick #HuskerSports",

        "title": "Nebraska Loses to No.23 USC in One Score Game as QB Dylan Raiola Leaves with Injury",
        "description": "Nebraska loses to No. 23 USC. Press release from Nebraska Athletics.\n\nEmmett Johnson carried 29 times for 165 yards and a touchdown on his way to crossing the 1,000-yard mark for the season and the 2,000-yard plateau for his career, but it was not enough to prevent Nebraska from suffering a 21-17 setback to No. 23 USC on Saturday night at Memorial Stadium.\n\nNebraska slipped to 6-3 overall and 3-3 in the Big Ten, while USC improved to 6-2 and 4-1 in the conference, despite the Blackshirts holding the nation's No. 1 overall offense and No. 1 passing offense nearly 200 yards under their season averages.\n\nThe Huskers played a strong first half in all phases, as the Blackshirts kept the high-power Trojan offense out of the end zone, while Johnson and quarterback Dylan Raiola helped the Big Red offense to a pair of touchdown drives.\n\nNebraska closed the first half with momentum, taking a 14-6 lead to halftime after a 10-yard Johnson touchdown run with 1:37 left in the second quarter. Not only did the Huskers take the eight-point lead, they also stopped USC on the ensuing drive and started the second half with the ball.\n\nJohnson carried much of the load for the Huskers in the first half, carrying 15 times for 76 yards and a touchdown, while Raiola completed 10-of-13 passes for 91 yards and a 14-yard touchdown strike to Dane Key.\n\nThe Huskers were unable to get anything going on their opening drive of the second half, but on USC's first snap, Andrew Marshall pulled down the first interception of his career to set Nebraska's offense up at the USC 34. \n\nRaiola and the Husker offense picked up a first down, but on 1st-and-10 from the USC 23, Raiola was sacked, fumbled and was knocked out of the game with a lower leg injury. Although Raiola continued to move up and down the sideline, he did not return to play.\n\nThe Blackshirts responded by holding USC on 4th-and-1 at the NU 47, and freshman TJ Lateef made his Big Ten debut, moving Nebraska within field goal range. But a 52-yard Kyle Cunanan attempt on 4th-and-1 at the USC 34 hit the right upright and fell to the ground in the freshly painted black north end zone.\n\nJayden Maiava and the USC offense capitalized five plays later with Maiava's 16-yard touchdown run to put the exclamation point on a 66-yard drive to pull within 14-12. USC went for the tie and King Miller converted with a run to tie the score at 14.\n\nLateef and the Husker offense found a response of their own, marching 57 yards on 10 plays capped by Cunanan's 39-yard field goal to put the Big Red back in front, 17-14, with 12:53 remaining. Lateef finished the game 5-of-7 passing, but the completions covered just seven yards. He added six carries for 18 yards on the ground.\n\nThe USC offense then supplied its final answer on the following drive with a six-play, 75-yard march kick-started by a 43-yard pass from Maiava to Jaden Richardson on 2nd-and-10 from the USC 25. It was Richardson's only catch of the night, while Maiava finished just 9-of-23 passing for 135 and an interceptions - nearly 200 yards below USC's nation-leading season average of 326 yards per game. It marked the first time in 83 games that the Trojans were held under 150 yards passing. Maiava added 62 yards on the ground, including USC's first touchdown.\n\nMiller, who did consistent damage in the Trojan rushing game throughout the night, capped game-winning drive with his six-yard touchdown run with 10:06 left. He finished with 129 yards on 18 carries with a touchdown, as USC produced 202 rushing yards on the night.\n\nUSC finished with 337 total yards - as the Blackshirts held the Trojans nearly 200 yards below their nation-leading season average of 530 yards per game.\n\nThe Trojan defense held the Husker offense to just 286 total yards, including 188 rushing and 98 passing.\n\nJavin Wright led the Blackshirts with 11 tackles, including a sack and a breakup, while Rex Guthrie added eight stops and DeShon Singleton and Vincent Shavers Jr. each contributed six tackles.\n\nNebraska returns to Big Ten road action next week when the Huskers travel to the Rose Bowl to battle UCLA. Kickoff with the Bruins is set for 8 p.m. (CT) with live national telecast on FOX.",

        "description": "Fans attending University of Nebraska at Kearney football games will notice several changes to the game-day experience, starting with the home opener against Chadron State on September 6. UNK is implementing a no-re-entry policy and a new bag-check procedure to enhance safety and streamline stadium operations.\n\nIn a significant update, alcohol sales will be introduced inside Cope Stadium during football games. The University of Nebraska Board of Regents approved the option for alcohol sales at NU athletic venues in October 2024, and UNK is moving forward with a plan that emphasizes responsibility, safety, and the fan experience.\n\n\"Offering beer and other alcoholic beverages in a regulated and responsible manner is a positive step for our program and our fans,\" said UNK Athletic Director Marc Bauer. \"We’ve allowed alcohol consumption in our Loper Fan Fest Tailgate area for years with no incidents. This policy allows us to extend that experience inside the stadium while prioritizing safety and fan behavior.\"\n\nRead more: https://nebraska.tv/news/local/unk-introduces-alcohol-sales-at-football-games-with-new-safety-measures#",

        "description": "Nebraska suffered its first loss of the season Saturday, falling 30-27 to No. 21 Michigan at Memorial Stadium in the Big Ten opener.\n\nFull game raw and uncut highlights: https://youtu.be/iWFLhJ9ZVfA\n\nThe Huskers (3-1, 0-1 Big Ten) were undone by two numbers: 286 rushing yards allowed and seven sacks given up on quarterback Dylan Raiola. The Wolverines (3-1, 1-0) controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, grinding down Nebraska’s defense on the ground while making Raiola uncomfortable in the pocket.\n\nRaiola still finished 30 of 41 for 308 yards and three touchdowns, marking his second 300-yard passing game of the season and extending his streak of multiple-touchdown performances to four straight games. His top target was sophomore receiver Jacory Barney Jr., who caught six passes for 120 yards and two scores, including a 52-yard Hail Mary touchdown to end the first half.\n\nNebraska’s defense held Michigan to 105 passing yards, continuing to show why it entered the game as the nation’s top-ranked passing defense. Still, missed tackles and blown assignments proved costly against the Wolverines’ powerful run game.\n\nThe loss extended Nebraska’s drought against ranked opponents. The Huskers have not beaten a nationally ranked team since 2016. The game came on a day when members of the 1995 national championship team were honored before kickoff, and Nebraska's own three-division championship boxer led them out of the tunnel.\n\nNebraska now enters its bye week before hosting Michigan State on Oct. 4 in Lincoln.\n\n#Huskers #cornhuskers #huskerfootball #dylanraiola #lukelindenmeyer #emmettjohnson #nebraskafootball #nebraskafb #ncaafootball",
