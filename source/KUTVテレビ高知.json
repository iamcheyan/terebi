Spencer Cox shifted his remarks Thursday to the disturbing video that has been widely shared online.\n\n“We are not wired as human beings biologically, historically, we have not evolved in a way that we are capable of processing those types of violent imagery,” Cox said. “This is not good for us. It is not good to consume.”\n\nThe governor drew a parallel to another dark time in U.S. history, comparing the moment Kirk was shot in front of thousands to political violence in the 1960s when JFK and MLK were shot and killed.\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/local/gov-cox-urges-utahns-to-log-off-after-graphic-charlie-kirk-shooting-video-spreads\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "Prosecutors and defense attorneys have begun outlining their next moves in the high-profile case of Tyler Robinson, the man accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.\n\nOn September 10th, 2025, 31-year-old political activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated in broad daylight on the campus of Utah Valley University. One bullet. 3,000 witnesses. And a 33-hour manhunt.\n\nCharlie Kirk brought his \"Prove Me Wrong\" tour to Utah Valley University. At 12:23 PM, just 23 minutes into the event, a student asked him about mass shootings in America. As Charlie began to answer, a single gunshot rang out from 200 yards away. The bullet struck him in the neck.\n\nThe shooter? Gone. Vanished into a nearby neighborhood.\n\nFor 33 hours, the FBI and Utah authorities searched. They recovered a high-powered rifle in the woods. They found footprints, palm prints, surveillance footage. They offered a $100,000 reward. But the shooter had disappeared.\n\nFULL STORY: https://bit.ly/4pPfxmj\n\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "The disappearance of 15-year-old Reed Taylor Jeppson from October 11, 1964 is believed to be one of Utah's oldest cold cases.\n\nJeppson left his home after returning from church with his family. He left to feed his two dogs and take them for a walk. Reed and the two dogs were never found. Various searches were conducted for Reed, and it's unclear if any of his clothing was ever located.\n\n\"We call these 'cold cases' but we don't ever consider these 'cold cases',\" said Sgt. Miles Southworth with Salt Lake City Police Department. \"This one, for instance, we continue working it. I was browsing through the case today, and we have over 150 reports between now and 1964. There have been a lot of people that have looked at this case, continued revisiting it, continued following leads.\"\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/utahs-missing/missing-since-october-1964-where-is-reed-jeppson\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

Video footage captured the suspect running from the shooting location across a nearby roof.\n\nInvestigators recovered what they believe to the murder weapon, a high-powered bolt action rifle, which was sent to an FBI laboratory for analysis.

My daughter-in-law Kim made this dish for us once with filet mignon, and it was a real treat! My daughter has a son who requests this meal once a week. She makes this recipe and then divides it into single serving portion sizes. She puts the individual meals into freezer containers and keeps them handy for when her son NEEDS to have his Beef Stroganoff. I think this is a great idea for a single person or couple that will have plenty of leftovers. It comes out tasting just as good as the day you made it. xo\n\nFULL RECIPE: https://kutv.com/features/food/recipes/cooking-with-the-food-nanny-beef-stroganoff\n\n#foodnanny #liziheaps #liziheapsfoodnanny #beefstroganoff  #mominfluencer #foodinspiration \n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "VIDEO COURTESY The Logan Herald Journal City Councilor Outburst\n\nA local city council member is facing backlash after a heated exchange with police officers, which was all captured on body camera footage. The incident, which occurred on August 3, 2025, has raised serious questions about the council member’s conduct and his stance on the local police department.\n\nSmithfield City Council member Ted Stokes is under scrutiny after a tense confrontation with police officers at his home. The officers had responded to a complaint regarding a car crash involving Stokes’ son. While the crash resulted in only minor injuries—a bloody nose—Stokes did not take kindly to the police response.\n\nBody camera footage obtained by The Herald Journal shows Stokes threatening to shrink the city’s police force, suggesting that only five officers should remain on the department. He also mocked the officers and criticized their training.\n\n“I promise you I will do everything in my power as a city council member to make sure these guys are defunded,” Stokes is heard saying in the video. “There will be five police officers in this town because this is unbelievable.”\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/local/smithfield-council-member-threatens-to-defund-police-department-in-heated-body-cam-footage\n\n#smithfield #councilmember #policedepartment #bodycamera #bodycamerafootage \n\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "CLEARFIELD, Utah — The family of a woman who disappeared more than two years ago recently conducted a search in Davis County.\n\nThe family of Tina Maria Jones, 52, reported her missing on Aug. 28, 2023. They said they last had contact with her on Aug. 9, and she checked out of a homeless shelter in Salt Lake City on Aug. 13.\n\nBetween Aug. 13 and Aug. 16, Jones was reportedly staying with an acquaintance at Clearfield Junction Apartments, located at 101 North Main Street. Residents there told police that they last saw Jones on Aug. 16 and said she left behind all of her personal belongings — aside from her wallet — at the apartment. Surveillance cameras from a nearby building show a woman resembling Jones walking on a sidewalk heading west towards the Center Street Bridge.\n\n\"We want to find her, we just want to find her,\" said Madison Madrigal, Tina's daughter in a recent interview with 2News. \"We just want closure, you know?\"\n\nFamily and friends of Tina Jones helped with a search on September 13, 2025.\n\nJones was described as being 5'5\" and approximately 180 lbs with dark brown hair in a pixie cut. She was last seen wearing a dark-colored shirt and dark-colored pants. Jones is considered endangered due to her mental illness.\n\nAnyone who has seen or had contact with Jones around the time of or after Aug. 16, 2023 is asked to call Clearfield Police Dispatch at (801) 525-2806.\n\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "title": "\"We got him\": Gov. Cox on arrest of Charlie Kirk assassination suspect",
        "description": "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox later confirmed Robinson's identity.\n\nBullet casings found near the rifle were engraved several messages, according to Gov. Cox. Inscriptions included \"Notices Bulges OWO What's this?\" on a fired casing. On three unfired casings, inscriptions included \"Hey Facist! Catch!\" with one up arrow, a right arrow and three down arrows, \"Oh Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao Ciao Ciao\" and a third casing read \"If you read this, you are gay, lmao.\"\n\nA manhunt for the suspect started just after noon on Sept. 10 when Kirk, a political activist known for touring university campuses and debating students, was shot and killed.\n\nKirk was making an appearance in the Utah Valley University's quad in Orem for the first stop of his \"American Comeback Tour.\" He was discussing gun violence and mass shooting with a student when he was fatally shot.\n\nEarly in the investigation, state and federal officials said they tracked the shooters movements from the time he got onto UVU's campus around 11:52 a.m. - about 20 minutes before the single gunshot. Video footage captured the suspect running from the shooting location across a nearby roof.\n\nInvestigators recovered what they believe to the murder weapon, a high-powered bolt action rifle, which was sent to an FBI laboratory for analysis. Investigators also collected a palm imprint, a shoe imprint, and forearm imprints from the scene.\n#shorts #charliekirk #charliekirkshooting #breakingnews \n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "Take 2 Podcast – October 9, 2025\n\nHosts: Heidi Hatch\n\nGuests: Maura Carabello, Exoro Group; Trent Staggs, Riverton Mayor and Small Business Administrator\n_____\nISRAEL–HAMAS PEACE DEAL MOVES FORWARD\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed on the first phase of a peace framework that would allow for the swift release of all hostages.\n\nStill missing from the plan are key details on Hamas’s disarmament and who will govern Gaza once the deal moves ahead. Those issues are expected to be part of later negotiations.\n_____\nGOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN – DAY 9\n\nThe federal government shutdown has entered its ninth day, with Affordable Care Act subsidies still a sticking point for Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have centered their messaging around health care for migrants, pushing for limits on taxpayer-funded benefits.\n\nIn Utah, undocumented migrants can access emergency medical care, and some coverage is available for children.\n_____\nNEW NUMBERS – UTAH RANKS 3RD IN MIGRANT ARRIVALS\n\nSalt Lake City is now one of the nation’s fastest-growing destinations for migrants, according to new data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBetween May 2023 and January 2025, nearly 2.5 million migrants who entered the U.S. — either illegally or through legal protection under the CBP One app — reported where they planned to live.\n\nMiami led with 2,191 arrivals per 100,000 residents, followed by Fort Myers, Florida, at 1,782. Salt Lake City ranked third with 1,685, just ahead of Denver and New York.\n\nAP Source\n_____\nNEW ICE DIRECTOR – AGREEMENTS WITH UTAH CITIES AND COUNTIES\n\nThe new ICE director is expanding partnerships with Utah law enforcement under three models:\n\nTask Force Model – Local officers working directly with federal agents.\nJail Enforcement Model – ICE cooperation within county jails.\nWarrant Service Officer Model – Deputized officers allowed to serve immigration-related warrants.\n_____\nUTAH SPECIAL SESSION\n\nLawmakers passed and the governor signed Map C, the new congressional redistricting plan. The map now heads to a judge for approval.\n\nWith the new boundaries, Utah could see as many as two competitive races in the 2026 election cycle.\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

There is no mention of any client list or anything that improves transparency or justice for victims,\" Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said in a statement to CNN.\n\nInformation included documents and surveillance video from the night of Epstein's death and court filings from Ghislaine Maxwell.

        "description": "The Strider Cup World Championship returns to Salt Lake for the first time in eight years, filling the Gallivan Center with young children competing in a unique bike race.\n\nThe event has riders as young as 2-years-old in a race on a balance bike. Founder Ryan McFarland talked about what makes the races so much fun for children.\n\nThe balance bike is designed without pedals. The bike moves as the rider moves their body – often using their feet on the ground.\n\n“They kind of Fred Flintstone it,” McFarland said. “They straddle the bike and run with their little legs.”\n\nThe bikes can be ridden by children as young as 2 years old.\n\n“It’s on two wheels, so they’re learning how to balance and learn to truly handle a bike from a young, young age,” he said. “Later on in life, they’ll never need training wheels – they’ll be able to transition on to a regular pedal bike with ease, and years earlier.”\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/arc-salt-lake/salt-lake-gallivan-center-hosts-world-balance-bike-races-for-young-children\n\n\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "Where is Kylie Arellano? The question still lingers with family, friends and law enforcement who've been trying to locate the 15-year-old who left her home on May 29, 2025 in Garden City, Utah.\n\nKylie, whose been featured on 'Utah's Missing' since her disappearance, missed the start of 10th grade and will turn 16-years-old in October. Her mother hasn't given up hope and continues to ask to anyone who thinks they've seen someone who looks like Kylie; to take a photo or video and share it with law enforcement immediately.\n\n“I put flyers up everywhere I could; I’ve done what I can,\" said Kylie's mother Stephanie Coleman to 2News on Wednesday, September 24. \"When I say she vanished off the face of this earth, I mean that.”\n\nThere's been no contact from Kylie with family or friends and no social media activity for roughly 117 days. Her mother believes she was coerced into leaving her home; although she's confirmed with Kylie's friends that she also discussed 'running away'. \n\n2News spoke with the Rich County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday. The Deputy who took over the case confirmed they've had possible sightings or tips and have followed up on each lead. \n\nAccording to Kylie's mother, there is no surveillance video showing Kylie in the Garden City area from the day(s) surrounding her disappearance. Kylie's 'missing' status is listed on two national databases including National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) and National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). It's not clear why Kylie is not listed on the Utah Department of Public Safety's missing person database. \n\nKylie is 5'6\" and weighs 115 lbs. She has chin-length brown hair and brown eyes. She has black braces and tattoos.\n\nIf you have any information, contact the Rich County Sheriff's Office: 435-793-2285, referencing case #25-R308.\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

Gary Herbert — who led the state from 2009 to 2021 and guided the Beehive State through multiple national challenges, including a previous federal shutdown.\n\nHerbert shared his perspective on how the current shutdown is hitting local families, the economic ripple effects on jobs and national parks, and how state leaders are responding. He also reflected on President Nelson’s legacy and offered insight into what’s at stake as lawmakers return to the Capitol for redistricting.\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/arc-salt-lake/former-gov-gary-herbert-talks-about-impact-of-government-shutdown-on-utah-families\n\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

Candice Pierucci, committee co-chair, harking to a 2018 initiative passed by voters, which established an independent commission to draw political maps.\n\nThe commission drew its lines, but the Republican-controlled Legislature made the commission an advisory body and approved its own map, sparking sharp criticism that lawmakers ignored the will of the people and were \"gerrymandering.\"\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/local/redistricting-chair-legislature-legally-cannot-select-map-from-independent-commission\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said Robinson’s mother recognized the \"person of interest\" photo released by police and suspected it was her son.\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-county-attorney-outlines-evidence-linking-tyler-robinson-to-charlie-kirk-killing\n\n@charliekirk @tylerrobinson #utahvalleyuniversity #uvu @charliekirkshooting \n\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.

        "description": "Victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who are fed up with the government run-around said they will compile their own \"client list\" on Wednesday during a rally on Capitol Hill after the House Oversight Committee released 33,000 pages of documents already seen by the public.\n\nThe documents released Tuesday night underwhelmed lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.\n\n“After careful review, Oversight Democrats have found that 97% of the documents received from the Department of Justice were already public. There is no mention of any client list or anything that improves transparency or justice for victims,\" Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said in a statement to CNN.\n\nInformation included documents and surveillance video from the night of Epstein's death and court filings from Ghislaine Maxwell. The main contents include flight logs, court filings and surveillance footage.\n\nAhead of a House news conference with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., survivors spoke, some for the first time publicly, about the abuse endured from Epstein and his former girlfriend and convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe first victim to tell her emotional story was Liz Stein, who said she was 21 years old when she was introduced to Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell, and it \"was the sliding glass doors moment that changed the trajectory of my entire life.\"\n\nFULL STORY: https://kutv.com/news/nation-world/we-know-the-names-jeffrey-epstein-victims-say-they-will-compile-their-own-client-list-virginia-giuffre-capitol-hill-house-oversight-committee-files-convicted-sex-offender-ghislaine-maxwell-human-trafficking-massages-justice-department-trump#\n_______________\nHit the subscribe button to stay up-to-date on the latest news, and turn on the notifications to get alerted when the big stories break as we bring them to you live!\n\nFor all the full stories seen here, go to kutv.com.\n\nFollow KUTV 2News on our other social media pages for more photos, videos and reports:\nFacebook: KUTV2News\nTikTok: @kutv2news\nX: @kutv2news\nInstagram: @kutv2news\nThreads: @kutv2news\nBluesky: @kutv2news.bsky.social\n\nIf you see something newsworthy happen, or you just witness something incredible, hilarious or adorable, you can send your videos, photos and news tips to kutv.com/chimein.
